If you are new to [Blueprints Visual Scripting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine) in Unreal Engine, these Blueprint Tutorials provide information on the core aspects needed to work with Blueprints including Creating Blueprints, Adding and Connecting Nodes, Creating Variables and others as seen in the tables below.

When you are ready and have an understanding of the core aspects behind Blueprints, Gameplay oriented Blueprint Tutorials can be found in [Gameplay Systems](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-systems-in-unreal-engine) which illustrate gameplay related elements like Spawning / Destroying Actors, Respawning (OnDestroyed), Using Timers, and more.
