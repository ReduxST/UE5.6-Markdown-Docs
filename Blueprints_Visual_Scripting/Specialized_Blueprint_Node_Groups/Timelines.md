## Overview (C++)

**UTimelineComponent** holds a series of **events**, **floats**, **vectors** or **colors** with their associated **keyframes**. They are inherited from [UActorComponents](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/Components/UActorComponent?application_version=5.5)

For further documentation, please see the overview about [Actor Components](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/components-in-unreal-engine)

Timelines allow for time-based animation which are played from Events that can be triggered at keyframes along the timeline. They can be used to handle simple, non-cinematic tasks such as opening doors, altering lights, or performing other time-centric manipulations to Actors within a scene. They are similar to [level sequences](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-sequencer-movie-tool-overview) as they both provide values such as floats, vectors, and colors to be interpolated between keyframes along the timeline.

## Inputs and Outputs

UTimelineComponents have robust methods that can be extended in native code, refer to the [UTimelineComponent](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/Components/UTimelineComponent?application_version=5.5) API reference for further documentation. If you would like to see examples on how to utilize Timeline Components in the engine, see one of the Timeline Example links in the section below.

```code
`/** Start playback of timeline */ 	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="Components|Timeline") 	ENGINE_API void Play();  	/** Start playback of timeline from the start */ 	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="Components|Timeline") 	ENGINE_API void PlayFromStart();  	/** Start playback of timeline in reverse */ 	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="Components|Timeline")`
