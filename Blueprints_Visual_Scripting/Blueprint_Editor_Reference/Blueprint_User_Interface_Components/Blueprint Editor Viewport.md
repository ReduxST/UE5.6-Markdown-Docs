In the **Viewport**, in the Blueprint Editor, you can view and manipulate your Blueprint's components.

You can also manipulate a selected component by adjusting its values manually in the [Details](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/details-panel-in-the-blueprints-visual-scriting-editor-for-unreal-engine) panel.

Selecting a component in the [Component](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/components-window-in-unreal-engine) list selects that component in the **Viewport** too, and populates the **Details** panel with its property information.

You can use the transformation widgets in the **Viewport** to adjust the location, rotation, and scale of selected components. For more information about transformation widgets, see [Interactive Transforms](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/transforming-actors-in-unreal-engine#interactivetransformation).

You can navigate in the Blueprint Editor's **Viewport** in the same ways in which you navigate in the Level Editor's **Viewport**. For more information, see [Viewport Controls](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/viewport-controls-in-unreal-engine).

## The View Menu

The **View** drop-down menu, in the **Viewport**'s upper-left corner, has somewhat different options than the Level Editor's **Viewport** menus.
