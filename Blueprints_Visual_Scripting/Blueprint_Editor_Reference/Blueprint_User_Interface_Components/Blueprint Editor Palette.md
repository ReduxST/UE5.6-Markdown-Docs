The **Palette** panel displays a list of all functions and variables that can be used in Blueprints. It is fully searchable, contains a **Favorites** panel that you can populate with the nodes you find yourself using the most, and you can filter it to search for nodes that are compatible with a specific class type. Nodes from the **Palette** panel can be added into your networks by simply dragging and dropping them from the list.

1.  **Favorites** - This shows your favorite and frequently used nodes. You can add nodes to this area by **Right clicking** them within the **Palette** panel and choosing **Add to Favorites**.
2.  **Palette list** - This is a list of all available functions, filterable by class and searchable.
3.  **Favorites search bar** - Actively filters the **Favorites** list while you type.
4.  **Class Filter** - This filters the **Palette** panel to only show nodes which are compatible with a specific class. See [Class Filtering](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/palette-in-the-bleprints-visual-scripting-editor-for-unreal-engine#classfiltering) for more details.
5.  **Palette search bar** - Actively filters the Palette list while you type.

## Class Filtering

Sometimes it is useful to filter down the **Palette** to only show those nodes that are compatible with a given class type. This is done using the **Class Filter** dropdown. When clicked, it shows a list of all classes available in your project, similar to the [Class Viewer](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/class-viewer-in-unreal-engine) panel. It also contains a search bar that you can use to actively filter down the list.
