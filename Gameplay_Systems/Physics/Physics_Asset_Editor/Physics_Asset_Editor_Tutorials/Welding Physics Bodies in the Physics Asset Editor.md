This how-to guide contains the procedures to **Weld** two or more **Physics Bodies** together in the **Physics Asset Editor**.

### Welding

Welding Physics Bodies will make multiple bodies interact as one, as well as lock together the Skeletal Mesh Joints they are associated with. To Weld one Physics Body to another:

1.  **Select**Â two or more Physics Bodies using **Ctrl + Left Mouse click**.
    
2.  Right-click one of the Physics Bodies to open the **Context menu**, then under **Collision** select the **Weld** option.

Any Physics Body welded to the currently selected Physics Body will show in yellow.
