Unreal Engine 5 includes a set of tools for simulating 2D and 3D fluid effects in real time. These systems use physically-based simulation methods to produce realistic effects for things such as fire, smoke, clouds, rivers, splashes, and waves breaking on a beach.

The toolset is designed to be artist-friendly and an open platform for experimentation by utilizing simulation stages, reusable modules, and robust Data Interfaces.

Artists can achieve their desired results in real time by modifying only a few parameters, while advanced users and R&D engineers can dive in and break apart the simulators to try new algorithms.

You can learn more about **Niagara** and **Fluid Simulation** by going to the [Niagara VFX System](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-visual-effects-in-niagara-for-unreal-engine) documentation.

This page provides a starting point to learn about fluid simulation in Unreal Engine.
