**Physical Materials** are used to define the response of a physical object when interacting dynamically with the world. Physical Materials are fairly easy to use. Creating one will give you a set of default values, identical to the default physical material that is applied to all physics objects. Examples of this would be a character's dead body (ragdoll), a movable crate, and so on.
