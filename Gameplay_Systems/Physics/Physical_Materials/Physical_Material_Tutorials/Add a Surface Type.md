The following steps detail how to add a **Physical Surface Type** to your project.

1.  In the main menu, click on **Edit -> Project Settings... -> Physics -> Physical Surface Category**.
2.  Change the **None** in the **Name** field next to a **SurfaceType#** to a name descriptive of what you'd like the Surface Type to represent (concrete, flesh, wood, and so on).
