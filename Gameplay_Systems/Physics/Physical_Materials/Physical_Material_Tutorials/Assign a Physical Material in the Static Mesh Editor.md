**Static Meshes** have both **Simple Collision** (the Physics Bodies that you create in your 3D art package or in the StaticMesh Editor) and **Complex Collision** (per poly collision) which can be composed of several different materials each with their differing Physical Materials. To set the Complex Collision Physical Material see: [Assign a Physical Material to a Material](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/assign-a-physical-material-to-a-material-in-unreal-engine).

To set the Simple Collision Physical Material for a Static Mesh:

1.  Double-click a **Static Mesh** in the **Content Drawer** to open it in the **Static Mesh Editor**.

2.  Use the **Simple Collision Physical Material** dropdown in the **Collision** category to select the desired Physical Material.
