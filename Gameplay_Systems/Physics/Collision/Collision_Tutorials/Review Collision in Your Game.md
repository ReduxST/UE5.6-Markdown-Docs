Here are a couple of console commands you can use while in game to give you information on the collision in your game.

1.  Run your game.
2.  Hit the **\`** (back tick/tilde key) to bring up the console input box.
3.  Enter one of the following commands:
    
    -   **show COLLISION** - This will draw all collision models and blocking volumes in use in the level.

    -   **stat game** - This shows you various useful stats on how long different types of collision are taking.
