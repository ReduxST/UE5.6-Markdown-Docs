Given the ever increasing complexity of 3D meshes, proxy shapes must be used to drive physics simulations in real time 3D rendering applications; Physics Bodies (Body Instances) are the simplified 3D meshes that Unreal Engine uses for physics simulations. They can be formed of boxes, spheres, capsules, or convex hulls.
