**Online Beacons** provide a lightweight mechanism for clients to communicate with servers without committing to a normal Unreal Engine (UE) network game connection. Online beacons derive from the actor class and provide a base framework. You can extend the framework in derived classes, so they can perform project-specific interactions and information requests. Some common use cases for online beacons include:

-   Calculating connection ping.
    
-   Reserving a spot in a game session.
    
-   Querying information about a game session or lobby before joining.
    

Typically, actor replication and spawning is initiated by an authoritative server. Since the server is usually authoritative, a client must connect to a server to first obtain a copy of an actor that the server has authority over. Online beacons work differently by providing clients with a system to create an actor that initiates contact with a server, then fires a delegate so the server beacon can call a [Remote Procedure Call](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/remote-procedure-calls-in-unreal-engine) (RPC) immediately after a client connects.

## Class Structure

The online beacon framework has the following structure:

-   AActor
    -   [`AOnlineBeacon`](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Plugins/OnlineSubsystemUtils/AOnlineBeacon)
        -   [`AOnlineBeaconHost`](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Plugins/OnlineSubsystemUtils/AOnlineBeaconHost)
        -   [`AOnlineBeaconClient`](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Plugins/OnlineSubsystemUtils/AOnlineBeaconClient)
    -   [`AOnlineBeaconHostObject`](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Plugins/OnlineSubsystemUtils/AOnlineBeaconHostObject)

### Online Beacon

Online Beacon is the base class for both `AOnlineBeaconClient` and `AOnlineBeaconHost`. You typically don’t need to override the online beacon itself, since you can override the online beacon client and online beacon host individually.

### Online Beacon Client

An online beacon client is the base class from which client implementations derive. This is the primary working class of the online beacon system.

This class has its own `UNetDriver` that initiates connection with the server. Once a connection between a client's and a server's copy of an online beacon client object is made, replication of the objects behaves like ordinary UE replication. Both the server and the client can call RPCs and the server's version of the online beacon client object is authoritative over property replication.

You typically spawn an online beacon client in client gameplay code, then connect to an online beacon host on the server with the `AOnlineBeaconClient::InitClient` function. You need to specify the online beacon client class you are using in your online beacon host object constructor so the server knows which client class to spawn and communicate with the client machine. You can override the `AOnlineBeaconClient::OnConnected` function to call RPCs as soon as a connection is established between server and client. You can also override the `AOnlineBeaconClient::OnFailure` function to perform custom failure handling.

### Online Beacon Host

Online beacon host is the base class hosts use to manage all beacon connections from clients. Online beacon host manages a registry of online beacon host objects to route traffic based on the type of online beacon client currently requesting a connection and communicating with the online beacon host.

The class has its own UNetDriver that listens for connections from clients. When an online beacon host receives a connection from a remote machine's online beacon client, the host scans its registry of online beacon host object instances to determine which one matches the incoming client, then transfers management of the connection to that online beacon host object.

You typically spawn an online beacon host in server gameplay code, for example, in your game mode class.

### Online Beacon Host Object

Online beacon host object is the base class for any host classes that handle traffic coming from an online beacon client.

This class spawns the appropriate online beacon client on the server to match the online beacon client on the client machine that initiated the connection. Online beacon host objects use the `ClientBeaconActorClass` member variable to determine the online beacon client class actor to spawn.

You typically spawn an online beacon host object in server gameplay code after you spawn an online beacon host, then register the online beacon host object with the online beacon host. Once an online beacon client connects to the online beacon host object that a delegate fires, and calls the `AOnlineBeaconHostObject::OnClientConnected` function. You can then call an RPC to initiate communication between client and host inside this function.

## Engine Example

Unreal Engine provides a small online beacon implementation in the header files `TestBeaconClient.h` and `TestBeaconHost.h` in the directory:

-   `..\Engine\Plugins\Online\OnlineSubsystemUtils\Source\OnlineSubsystemUtils\Classes\`

The implementations are contained in the associated `.cpp` files in the directory:

-   `..\Engine\Plugins\Online\OnlineSubsystemUtils\Source\OnlineSubsystemUtils\Private\`

The test beacon implementation repeatedly calls RPCs back-and-forth between a server and a client, printing a short log message each time. The following section describes what you must do to spawn test beacons in your gameplay code.

### Spawn Test Beacons

To use the `TestBeaconClient` and `TestBeaconHost` classes in your project, follow these steps:

1.  In your server gameplay code, spawn an `ATestBeaconHost`.
    
2.  In your client gameplay code, spawn an `ATestBeaconClient`.
    
3.  Connect the client to the server with a call to `ATestBeaconClient::InitClient(url)` in your client gameplay code, where `url` is a `FURL` object with the server's address and port.
    

Once you click **Begin Play**, your gameplay code spawns a test beacon host on the server and a test beacon client on every client. The following section describes the resulting process flow that automatically occurs between the test beacons.

### Process Flow of Test Beacons

This section describes the process flow after your game spawns the test beacons when you begin play:

-   First, the `ATestBeaconHost` constructor sets the member variable `ClientBeaconActorClass` to the class `ATestBeaconClient` and sets the `BeaconTypeName` member variable to `ClientBeaconActorClass->GetName()`. This ensures that the online beacon system pairs the test beacon host and test beacon client classes together so the server spawns the correct client class to match the client class initiating a connection.
    
-   When a client machine's `ATestBeaconClient` object contacts the server, the server's `AOnlineBeaconHost` instance directs the registered `ATestBeaconHost` to spawn its own `ATestBeaconClient` and associate it with the `ATestBeaconClient` on the client machine. There is now a test beacon client on the client machine, and a test beacon client on the server machine. Furthermore, the network connection facilitates client and server RPCs to pass information between the two `ATestBeaconClient` instances.
    
-   Next, the server's `ATestBeaconHost` calls `ATestBeaconHost::OnClientConnected`. Within the function `ATestBeaconHost::OnClientConnected`, the server's test beacon client instance initiates a ping with a call to the client RPC `ClientPing`.
    
-   When the client machine's `ATestBeaconClient` instance receives the RPC and executes the `ATestBeaconClient::ClientPing_Implementation`, the client's test beacon client first prints `LogBeacon: Ping` in the client log, then calls the server RPC `ServerPong`.
    
-   Last, when the server machine's `ATestBeaconClient` instance receives the RPC and executes the `ATestBeaconClient::ServerPong_Validate` function, the server validates that the program is not running in a shipping configuration. If the validation succeeds, then `ATestBeaconClient::ServerPong_Implementation` executes. Within the function `ATestBeaconClient::ServerPong_Implementation`, the server's beacon client first prints `LogBeacon: Pong` in the server log, then calls the client RPC `ClientPing`. This call to `ClientPing` causes the previous bullet point and this one to repeat.
    

This process continues indefinitely, and provides an example of an online beacon implementation that you can expand upon in any way that suits your project's needs.

If you want to stop the process after one back-and-forth, you can remove the call to `ClientPing` in the `ATestBeaconClient::ServerPong_Implementation`.

In addition to this engine example, this documentation page provides a step-by-step implementation guide for online beacons in the [Implement an Online Beacon](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-online-beacons-in-unreal-engine#implementanonlinebeacon) section below.

## Engine Configuration

To use online beacons in your project, you must first configure them. There are several engine configuration options available.

To start configuring an online beacon, add the following to your project's DefaultEngine.ini file:

```
	`[/Script/Engine.Engine] 	+NetDriverDefinitions=(DefName="BeaconNetDriver",DriverClassName="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver",DriverClassNameFallback="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver")  	[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeacon] 	BeaconConnectionInitialTimeout=30.0 	BeaconConnectionTimeout=45.0  	;[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeaconClient] 	;BeaconConnectionInitialTimeout= 	;BeaconConnectionTimeout=  	[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeaconHost] 	ListenPort=8888 	bReuseAddressAndPort=false 	bAuthRequired=false 	MaxAuthTokenSize=1024`
Copy full snippet
```
\[/Script/Engine.Engine\] +NetDriverDefinitions=(DefName="BeaconNetDriver",DriverClassName="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver",DriverClassNameFallback="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver") \[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeacon\] BeaconConnectionInitialTimeout=30.0 BeaconConnectionTimeout=45.0 ;\[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeaconClient\] ;BeaconConnectionInitialTimeout= ;BeaconConnectionTimeout= \[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeaconHost\] ListenPort=8888 bReuseAddressAndPort=false bAuthRequired=false MaxAuthTokenSize=1024

### Configuration Reference

This section explains what each of the above configuration options are used for, and how you should configure them for your project.

#### Engine

The following configures the beacon network driver to drive network traffic for online beacons:

```
	`[/Script/Engine.Engine] 	+NetDriverDefinitions=(DefName="BeaconNetDriver",DriverClassName="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver",DriverClassNameFallback="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver")`
Copy full snippet
```
\[/Script/Engine.Engine\] +NetDriverDefinitions=(DefName="BeaconNetDriver",DriverClassName="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver",DriverClassNameFallback="/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.IpNetDriver")

This example uses the `IpNetDriver` as the network driver class. To use a different network driver class, specify the class you would like to use in the `DriverClassName` field.

#### Online Beacon

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Beacon Connection Initial Timeout | Time the beacon waits to establish a connection with the beacon host. |
| Beacon Connection Timeout | Time the beacon waits for packets after establishing a connection before giving up. |

#### Online Beacon Client

| **Field** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Beacon Connection Initial Timeout | Time the beacon waits to establish a connection with the beacon host. |
| Beacon Connection Timeout | Time the beacon waits for packets after establishing a connection before giving up. |

#### Online Beacon Host

| **Field** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Listen Port | Configured listen port for this beacon host. |   |
| Reuse Address and Port | 
Whether to configure the listening socket to allow reuse of the address and port.

If this is true, make sure that no other servers can run on the same port, otherwise this can lead to undefined behavior since packets will go to two servers.



 | false |
| Auth Required | Set this to true if you require clients to negotiate auth prior to joining the beacon. | false |
| Max Auth Token Size | Maximum authentication token size. Only used if Auth Required is set to true. | 1024 |

Ensure that the Listen Port configured for your online beacon host is the same as the port you are passing in the `FURL` object to your online beacon client's `InitClient` function.

## Implement an Online Beacon

This section contains a sample implementation of an online beacon to calculate server-client ping round-trip time (RTT). The round-trip time is the amount of time it takes for a packet to be sent from client to server and then back to the client again. This is a small implementation and only provides a brief introduction to what online beacons are capable of, but it aims to give you a working example to get you started with an implementation beyond the test beacon and adds to it by explaining how to set up online beacons in your gameplay code.

This online beacon sample is implemented with a combination of C++ and Blueprints and makes use of UE's reflection system [Function Metadata Specifiers](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/metadata-specifiers-in-unreal-engine#functionmetadataspecifiers) and [Class Metadata Specifiers](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/metadata-specifiers-in-unreal-engine#classmetadataspecifiers) for both [Remote Procedure Calls](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/remote-procedure-calls-in-unreal-engine) and exposing certain functions to [Blueprint Visual Scripting](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine).

To implement a ping program with Unreal Engine's online beacons, follow these steps:

1.  Create or open an Unreal Engine C++ project.
    
2.  Use the C++ Class Wizard to create three new C++ classes:
    
    -   A class titled `PingClient` derived from `OnlineBeaconClient`.
        
    -   A class titled `PingHost` derived from `OnlineBeaconHost`.
        
    -   A class titled `PingHostObject` derived from `OnlineBeaconHostObject`.
        
3.  Add the code in the [Ping Beacon Code](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-online-beacons-in-unreal-engine#pingbeaconcode) section to the respective header and source files:
    
    -   [Ping Client Code](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-online-beacons-in-unreal-engine#pingclient)
        
    -   [Ping Host Code](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-online-beacons-in-unreal-engine#pinghost)
        
    -   [Ping Host Object Code](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-online-beacons-in-unreal-engine#pinghostobject)
        
4.  Add the following function to your project's game mode file:
    

Header

```
	`public:	 		bool InitPingBeacon();`
Copy full snippet
```
public: bool InitPingBeacon();

Source

```
	`bool ABeaconsGameMode::InitPingBeacon() 	{ 		ENetMode Mode = GetNetMode(); 		if (Mode == NM_DedicatedServer || Mode == NM_ListenServer) 		{ 			APingHost* Host = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<APingHost>(APingHost::StaticClass()); 			if (Host && Host->InitializeHost()) 			{ 				APingHostObject* HostObject = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<APingHostObject>(APingHostObject::StaticClass()); 				if (HostObject) 				{ 					Host->RegisterHostObject(HostObject); 					return true; 				} 			} 		} 		return false; 	}`
Copy full snippet
```
bool ABeaconsGameMode::InitPingBeacon() { ENetMode Mode = GetNetMode(); if (Mode == NM\_DedicatedServer || Mode == NM\_ListenServer) { APingHost\* Host = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<APingHost>(APingHost::StaticClass()); if (Host && Host->InitializeHost()) { APingHostObject\* HostObject = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<APingHostObject>(APingHostObject::StaticClass()); if (HostObject) { Host->RegisterHostObject(HostObject); return true; } } } return false; }

1.  In your game mode's `BeginPlay` function, call the `InitPingBeacon`.
    
2.  Make sure that you have configured your project to use online beacons by adding the configuration in the [Engine Configuration](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-online-beacons-in-unreal-engine#engineconfiguration) section to your project's `DefaultEngine.ini` file.
    
3.  Add the following to a Blueprint that only runs in your client game instance. This sample used the [Third Person Template](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/third-person-template-in-unreal-engine), so this code is added to the **BP\_ThirdPersonCharacter**:

## Test Your Online Beacon Implementation

To test the implementation of your online beacon, you must run your project with either a dedicated or listen server and at least one standalone client. You do not need to connect your client to the server with the `open` console command. This is a key feature of online beacons, clients can initiate contact with the server and then disconnect in a quick transaction.

To test your online beacon implementation:

1.  Mare sure that you have compiled your project successfully.
    
2.  Open your project in the Unreal Editor.
    
3.  In the **Editor Preferences**, change the **Level Editor > Play** settings to the following:
    
    -   Under **Play in Standalone Game**:
        
        -   Set **Additional Launch Parameters** to `-WINDOWED -ResX=800 -ResY=640 -log`.
    -   Under **Multiplayer Options**:
        
        -   Enable **Launch Separate Server**.
            
        -   Set **Play Net Mode** to **Play Standalone**.
            
        -   Disable **Run Under One Process**.
            
        -   Set **Additional Server Launch Parameters** to `-log`.
            
        
        Click image to expand.
        
4.  Click **Play**. You should see three new windows appear: a server log window, a client log window, and a client game instance.
    
5.  If you see the following line in your client log window, the ping beacon has succeeded:
    
    ```
             `LogPingClient: Ping Complete: 29 ms`
    Copy full snippet
    ```
    LogPingClient: Ping Complete: 29 ms
    
    The actual ms count might vary.
    

### Debugging

If you do not see the above line in your client log window, then the ping beacon likely did not succeed. If the ping beacon does not succeed, check the following.

#### Port

Make sure your client online beacon specifies the same port as the server online beacon in the engine configuration.

```
	`[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeaconHost] 	ListenPort=8888`
Copy full snippet
```
\[/Script/OnlineSubsystemUtils.OnlineBeaconHost\] ListenPort=8888

#### Network Driver

Make sure your server created a network driver to listen on this specified port.

```
	`LogNet: IpNetDriver_1 IpNetDriver_1 IpNetDriver listening on port 8888`
Copy full snippet
```
LogNet: IpNetDriver\_1 IpNetDriver\_1 IpNetDriver listening on port 8888

If you do not see a line similar to this in your log that specifies the same port as above, review the [Engine Configuration](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-online-beacons-in-unreal-engine#engineconfiguration) section above.

## Logging

Online Beacons use the `LogBeacon` log category to log all online beacon network traffic. `LogNet` and `LogHandshake` are additional log categories that can be useful for debugging online beacons.
