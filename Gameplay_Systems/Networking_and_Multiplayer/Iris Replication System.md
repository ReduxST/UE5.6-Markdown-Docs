**Iris** is an opt-in replication system that works alongside Unreal Engine's existing replication system. Iris builds on Epic's experience with Fortnite Battle Royale to create a replication system that supports:

-   Larger, more interactive worlds.
-   Higher player counts.
-   Lower server costs.

If you are creating a networked multiplayer game in Unreal Engine, you can choose to use the existing replication system or the Iris replication system. For more information about replication systems in Unreal Engine, see:
