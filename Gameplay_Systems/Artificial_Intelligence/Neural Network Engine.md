The **Neural Network Engine (NNE)** provides a common API to access different neural network runtimes, and to evaluate neural networks without the need of runtime specific coding. NNE has various uses that can be applied to real-time inference to augment a game with artificial intelligence (AI) and to implement editor-based features as asset operations, queries, and artist-assisting tools.
