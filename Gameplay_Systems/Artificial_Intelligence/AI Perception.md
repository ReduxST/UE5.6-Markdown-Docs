In addition to [Behavior Trees](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/behavior-trees-in-unreal-engine) which can be used to make decisions on which logic to execute, and the [Environmental Query System (EQS)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/environment-query-system-in-unreal-engine) used to retrieve information about the environment; another tool you can use within the AI framework which provides sensory data for an AI is the **AI Perception System.** This provides a way for Pawns to receive data from the environment, such as where noises are coming from, if the AI was damaged by something, or if the AI sees something. This is accomplished with the **AI Perception Component** which acts as a stimuli listener and gathers registered Stimuli Sources.

When a stimuli source is registered, the event **On Perception Updated** (or **On Target Perception Updated** for target selection) is called which you can use to fire off a new Blueprint Script and (or) update variables that are used to validate branches in a Behavior Tree.

## AI Perception Component

The **AI Perception Component** is a type of **Component** that can be added to a Pawn's AIController Blueprint from the **Components** window and is used to define what senses to listen for, the parameters for those senses, and how to respond when a sense has been detected. You can also use several different functions to get information about what was sensed, what Actors were sensed, or even disable or enable a particular type of sense.

To add the **AI Perception Component**, click the **+Add**button in your Blueprint and select **AIPerception**.

[![Click the +Add button in your Blueprint and select AIPerception](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/172dbdff-25dc-4397-9e5c-88875a93b8f4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/172dbdff-25dc-4397-9e5c-88875a93b8f4?resizing_type=fit)

Once the **AI Perception Component** has been added, you can access its properties inside the **Details** panel.

### AI Perception Properties

In addition to the common properties available in the **Details** panel for the **AI Perception Component**, you can add the type of **Senses** to perceive under the **AI Perception** and **Senses Config** section. Depending on the type of **Sense**, different properties are available to adjust how the **Sense** is perceived.

[![Depending on the type of Sense, different properties are available to adjust how the Sense is perceived](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6085396e-f9fe-47f9-af26-79cbb5f607a9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6085396e-f9fe-47f9-af26-79cbb5f607a9?resizing_type=fit)

The **Dominant Sense** property can be used to assign a **Sense** that should take precedence over other senses when determining a sensed Actor's location. This should be set to one of the senses configured in your **Senses Config** section or set to **None**.

#### AI Damage

If you want your AI to react to damage events such as **Event Any Damage**, **Event Point Damage**, or **Event Radial Damage**, you can use the **AI Damage Sense Config**. The **Implementation** property (which defaults to the engine class **AISense\_Damage**) can be used to determine how damage events are handled, however, you can create your damage classes through C++ code.

[![You can use the AI Damage Sense Config](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0d2cab19-4912-441c-a37b-6135ac29b030?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0d2cab19-4912-441c-a37b-6135ac29b030?resizing_type=fit)

### Perception Function Calls

The following functions can be called through Blueprint to get information from or affect the Perception System.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 
**Get Actors Perception**

 | 

Retrieves whatever has been sensed about a given Actor and returns a Sensed Actor's Data structure.

 |
| 

**Get Currently Perceived Actors**

 | 

Returns all Actors that are being perceived based on a given Sense. If no Sense is specified, all Actors currently perceived in any way will be returned.

 |
| 

**Get Known Perceived Actors**

 | 

Returns any Actors that have been perceived (and not yet forgotten) based on a given Sense. If no Sense is specified, all Actors that have been perceived will be returned.

 |
| 

**Get Perceived Hostile Actors**

 | 

Returns the list of Hostile Actors (any hostile Actors that had a stimulus sensed which is not expired or successfully sensed). The method can be overridden in Blueprint to return whatever Actors list the user wants.

 |
| 

**Request Stimuli Listener Update**

 | 

Manually forces the AI Perception System to update properties for the specified target stimuli listener.

 |
| 

**Set Sense Enabled**

 | 

Enable or Disable the specified **Sense Class**.

This only works if the given Sense has already been configured for the target component instance.



 |
| 

Forget All

 | 

Cleans up all previous perception data. 

 |

### Forget Perception Event

You can configure the AI Perception system to forget and subsequently clean up perception data. To use this, you must set Project Settings > Engine > AI System > Forget Stale Actors to true. After that, you can use the **Max Age** property in the AI Sense Config to set how long it takes for perception to time out. It will forget any Actor that is not perceived for that duration. 

## Stimuli Source

The **AI Perception Stimuli Source** Component gives the owning Actor a way to automatically register itself as a stimuli source for the designated Sense(s) within the Perception System. An example use case would be to have an AI character with an AI Perception Component set up to perceive stimuli based on Sight. You could then use the Stimuli Source Component in an Actor (such as an item pickup Actor) and register it as a stimuli for Sight (which would enable the AI to "see" the Actor in the Level).

To add the **AI Perception Stimuli Source** Component, click the **+Add**button in your Blueprint and select **AIPerception Stimuli Source**.

[![Click the +Add button in your Blueprint and select AIPerception Stimuli Source](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a41e569-bbd7-464f-af7c-c7eba7d6ffac?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a41e569-bbd7-464f-af7c-c7eba7d6ffac?resizing_type=fit)

Once the **AI Perception Stimuli Source** Component has been added, you can access properties for it inside the **Details** panel.

### Stimuli Properties

In the **Details** panel for the **AI Perception Stimuli Source** Component, the following two options are available for AI Perception:

 |
| 

**Register with Perception System**

 | 

Registers owning Actor as a stimuli source for Senses specified in the **Register as Source for Senses** property and through the **Register for Sense** function call.

You do not need to call this function if the Auto Register as Source property is enabled.

 |
| 

**Unregister from Perception System**

 | 

Unregisters the owning Actor from being a source of Sense stimuli.

 |
| 

**Unregister from Sense**

 |
