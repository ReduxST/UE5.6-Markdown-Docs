**Mutable** is a toolset for Unreal Engine that generates dynamic skeletal meshes, materials and textures in editor or at runtime. It is designed to help artists and designers create character customization systems but can generate a variety of dynamic content, such as animals, props, and other skeletal mesh assets.
