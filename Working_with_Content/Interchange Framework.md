The **Interchange Framework** is Unreal Engine's import and export framework. It is file format agnostic, asynchronous, customizable, and can be used at runtime.

Interchange uses a code base that is extensible and provides a customizable pipeline stack. This gives you the freedom to edit the import pipeline using Blueprint or Python to fit your project's needs.
