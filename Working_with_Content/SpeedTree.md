SpeedTree is a procedural generation application designed to create foliage for digital applications. Unreal Engine supports the SpeedTree `.st9` format, as well as the legacy `.st` format. For more information on using SpeedTree with Unreal Engine, see the [SpeedTree documentation](https://docs9.speedtree.com/modeler/doku.php?id=start).

Unreal Engine imports your SpeedTree content using a set of Material and Material Functions that are found in the `Engine/Plugins/SpeedTree Importer Content` folder.
