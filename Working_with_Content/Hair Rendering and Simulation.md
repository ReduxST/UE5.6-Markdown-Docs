Unreal Engine's groom rendering and simulation system uses a strand-based workflow to render each individual strand of hair with physically accurate motion, enabling artists to simulate and render hundreds of thousands (or more) photo-real hairs in real-time. Traditionally, hair created for use in real-time projects has been created using card-based techniques, or other similar approximations. The groom system in Unreal Engine manages and utilizes these methods, as well.
