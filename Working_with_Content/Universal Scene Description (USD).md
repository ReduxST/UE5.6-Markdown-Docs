The **Universal Scene Description (USD)** interchange format is an open-source format developed by Pixar to address the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed of many elemental assets. USD not only provides a rich toolset for reading, writing, editing, and rapidly previewing 3D geometry and shading, but also provides for the interchange of elemental assets (for example, models) or animations.
