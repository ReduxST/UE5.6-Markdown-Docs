One of the goals of Datasmith is to support the widest range of industry standard 3D design file formats used across industries including architecture, engineering, construction and manufacturing. For the most part, Datasmith treats each of these supported file formats in similar ways, and produces similar results, as described in the [Datasmith Overview](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/datasmith-plugins-overview).

However, each of these supported file formats presents unique challenges and opportunities for the import process. The guides listed below detail additional considerations that are specific to each different data source.
