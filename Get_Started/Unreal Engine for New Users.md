In this tutorial series you will learn how to create a first person adventure game from scratch. You will start by installing and configuring Unreal Engine, learning about the interface and navigation controls, and selecting one or more learning tracks based on your interests. Finally, you will learn how to package your project so you can freely play it in any windows-based computer.

The [Programmer Track](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/code-a-firstperson-adventure-game-in-unreal-engine) will teach you how to start coding a first person adventure game from scratch. You will learn how to setup your player character, add a camera, and control it inside a level. You will also learn how to create a pick up system where the player can pick up tools, weapons, or any other gameplay object.  

Now that you followed your desired learning track, you can package your project into a working game that you can run on any target machine.

## Last Step: Package your Project
