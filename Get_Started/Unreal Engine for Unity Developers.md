If you want to switch from Unity to Unreal Engine, this section serves as a starting point to:

-   Outline the similarities and differences between Unity and Unreal Engine.
    
-   Help you transfer your Unity knowledge to Unreal Engine by mapping out how specific Unity terms translate to Unreal Engine terms.
    
-   Understand the difference between Blueprint and C++ and when to use Blueprint or C++, depending on the needs of your project.
    
-   Learn how to import Unity assets into Unreal Engine
    
-   Understand rendering in Unreal Engine
    

If you have never used Unreal Engine before, start by reading the [Unity to Unreal Engine Overview](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unity-to-unreal-engine-overview) page, which maps key Unity terms and concepts to their Unreal Engine equivalents.
