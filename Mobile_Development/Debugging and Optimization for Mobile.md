Many mobile devices have significant hardware limitations compared with desktop hardware and game consoles, especially in terms of compatibility with graphics features. To address this, **Unreal Engine** has an alternate rendering path for mobile devices. This rendering path uses simplified or performance-oriented models for many of Unreal's rendering features, such as shadows and textures, and it removes many unsupported post-processes. The guides in this section provide details about configuration options and features in the mobile renderer.
