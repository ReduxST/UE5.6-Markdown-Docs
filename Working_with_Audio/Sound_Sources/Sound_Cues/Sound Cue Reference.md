In **Unreal Engine**, a **Sound Cue** is an audio asset that encapsulates complex sound design tasks within a node graph. Sound Cues provide audio designers freedom to dynamically change parts of a sound effect's design by arranging and modifying Sound Nodes to create complex and interesting audio output.

In the Sound Cue Editor, a list of Sound Node types is provided within the **Palette** panel. Selecting a node in the **Viewport** panel will display the node's properties in the **Details** panel.

![Sound Cue Editor Palette Panel](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/e3176bcd-cc8f-4ec2-ad09-9d5a80706174/sound-cue-editor-palette-panel.png)

For more about working with Sound Cues, see the [Sound Cue Editor](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-editor-in-unreal-engine) and [Sound Cue Editor UI](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-editor-ui-in-unreal-engine) documentation.

## Named Parameters

In some Sound Nodes, you can declare a parameter by entering a new parameter name. When you enter a parameter name in a node, it will create a parameter with that name.

![Named Parameter Example](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/783eba73-914c-4095-a9d1-e9f18ba0992d/named-parameter-example.png)

You can name the parameter whatever you want. However, when you use an **Audio Component Function** to set the parameter's value, its **In Name** field must exactly match the Parameter Name you gave it.

You cannot set the values for a named parameter from within a Sound Cue. A recommended workflow would be:

-   Add a Sound Node.
-   Enter a name in the node **Parameter Name** field.
-   Call the relevant audio component function from within a Blueprint, or in code, using the appropriate Set \[Name\] Parameter function.
-   Add the same name to the **In Name** parameter. This will get the Sound Cue to respond as expected.

![Set Wave Parameter Blueprint Example](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/8fba3a6e-3bb9-4867-be4e-6182ac3861bf/set-wave-parameter-blueprint-example.png)

The table below shows the nodes that can use named parameters, and the corresponding parameter setting functions.

| Node Type | Corresponding Function |
| --- | --- |
| Branch | Set Boolean Parameter |
| Continuous Modulator | Set Float Parameter |
| Crossfade by Param | Set Float Parameter |
| SoundClass | Set Wave Parameter |
| Switch | Set Integer Parameter |
| Wave Param | Set Wave Parameter |

## Output Node

An **Output** node is required in every Sound Cue and works as an end point for the audio signal path in the node graph. The Output node's properties are relative and affect all of the audio output contained within the Sound Cue.

![Output Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/48416cae-960f-4d1a-9110-b7298aee1731/output-sound-node.png)

## Attenuation Node

The **Attenuation** node controls volume for a sound based on the distance of the sound source from the listener.

The **Attenuation Settings** can be set to an existing **Sound Attenuation** asset or manually specified in the node's properties by enabling the **Override Attenuation** setting.

For an overview on attenuation and how it works, see the [Sound Attenuation](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-attenuation-in-unreal-engine) documentation.

![Attenuation Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/831f3114-e43b-4de8-b735-98cbb8e71d27/attenuation-sound-node.png)

 |
| Priority Attenuation At Min Distance | The interpolated value to scale priority against when the sound is at the minimum priority attenuation distance from the closest listener. |
| Priority Attenuation At Max Distance | The interpolated value to scale priority against when the sound is at the maximum priority attenuation distance from the closest listener. |
| Priority Attenuation Min Distance | The minimum distance to attenuate priority. |
| Priority Attenuation Max Distance | The maximum distance to attenuate priority. |
| Attenuation Priority | (For **Priority Attenuation Method**: Manual) The priority level entered is static and does not change with distance. |

 |
| **Attenuation (Source Data Override)** | Â  |
| Enable Source Data Override | Enables overriding WaveInstance data using source data override plugins. |
| Source Data Override Plugin Settings | An array of settings assets for source data override plugins. As this is an array, multiple settings can be applied. |

Stereo files play evenly on the left and right channels, and attenuate to allow volume fades between the Radius Min and Radius Max values, but they are not spatialized.

Sound Cues that do not contain an Attenuation node are not localized, and play consistently at the Sound Cue volume setting.

## Branch Node

The **Branch** node selects an input node based on the value of a named Boolean parameter of **True**, **False** or **Parameter Unset**.

Parameter Unset is the output that plays when the value of a named parameter has not been set. For example, if the parameter is saved as `Name` in the Branch node, but the user hasn't called `SetBooleanParam(Name, [true or false])`, the Sound Cue will use the Parameter Unset input pin, not the True or False pin.

For more information about named parameters, see the [Named Parameters](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-reference-for-unreal-engine#namedparameters) section of this page.

![Branch Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/8e265807-2d0a-459f-9c77-13955b8590b2/branch-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bool Parameter Name | The name of the Boolean parameter that determines which input node is used. |

## Concatenator Node

The **Concatenator** node is used to play sounds sequentially (for example, creating a simple BGM playlist that plays through a series of specified tracks). While this node handles sequential playback, it will also add a small delay between each asset.

Initially, this node has two input pins. You may add more pins by clicking the **Add input** button on the node or remove pins by right-clicking them and selecting "Delete Input" from the context menu.

![Concatenator Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/d5c6c6f5-17ed-4794-9cee-1ec4d8281035/concatenator-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Input Volume | An array which stores the volume multiplier for each attached input sound. |

## Continuous Modulator Node

The **Continuous Modulator** node provides a way to control named parameters for volume and pitch modulation in real time. A typical example would be using the velocity of a vehicle to correspond to the pitch of an engine sound. This modulator needs to be hooked up in code or Blueprint to work, and does not function on its own within the Sound Cue Editor. However, you can change pitch and volume from within the Sound Cue Editor.

By setting maximum and minimum values, you can determine the range of randomization.

The pitch and volume of the input sound will default to a uniform distribution, but you can change them in the Sound Cue Editor to any other type.

For more information about named parameters, see the [Named Parameters](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-reference-for-unreal-engine#namedparameters) section of this page.

![Continuous Modulator Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/f88320cc-12ba-4177-a09a-47723361e6e6/continuous-modulator-sound-node.png)

| Param Mode | 
The mode with which the parameter is applied:

-   **Normal:** Clamps input value to the range (MinInput, MaxInput), then maps to the range (MinOutput, MaxOutput).
-   **Absolute:** Same as Normal, except that the input value is treated as an absolute value.
-   **Direct:** Uses the input value directly, without scaling or reference to Min or Max input or output values.



 |

-   **Absolute:** Same as Normal, except that the input value is treated as an absolute value.
-   **Direct:** Uses the input value directly, without scaling or reference to Min or Max input or output values.

## Crossfade by Distance Node

The **Crossfade by Distance** node provides the ability to fade between two or more input sounds based on the distance from the Sound Cue's origin to the listener.

For example, a gunshot heard at a distance will sound different from a gunshot up close. This node can calculate the distance the listener is from the shot and play the sound based on a short or long distance, or a mix of the two.

This node differs from the Attenuation node in that the sound will only play if it is within the minimum and maximum distance settings.

Sound Nodes can be connected directly to the Crossfade by Distance node inputs, but you can also add nodes between them for independent control per layer.

Initially, this node has two input pins. Add more pins by clicking **Add input**.

![Crossfade by Distance Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/8db18fac-28bb-456c-9305-86753438434d/crossfade-by-distance-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cross Fade Input** | Â  |
| Fade in Distance Start | The distance from the listener's position at which the sound begins to be audible. |
| Fade in Distance End | The distance from the listener's position at which the sound reaches full volume. |
| Fade Out Distance Start | The distance from the listener's position at which the sound begins to fade out. |
| Fade Out Distance End | The distance from the listener's position at which the sound is no longer audible. |
| Volume | The maximum volume of the input sound. |

If you want to hear the sound up close, then setting **Fade in Distance Start** to 0 might be a good option.

These values can be set independently for each attached sound.

## Crossfade by Param Node

The **Crossfade by Param** node works similarly to the **Crossfade by Distance** node, except that the **Crossfade by Param** node provides a way for you to manipulate the value of a named parameter that controls the crossfade programmatically (with code or Blueprints).

Initially, this node has two input pins. You may add more pins by clicking the **Add input** button on the node or remove pins by right-clicking them and selecting "Delete Input" from the context menu.

For more information about named parameters, see the [Named Parameters](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-reference-for-unreal-engine#namedparameters) section of this page.

![Crossfade by Param Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/2f32298f-c586-4d30-9cde-68d8ccd27684/crossfade-by-param-sound-node.png)

The diagram above shows the expected volume change over time of two parameters based on the the given property values.

## Delay Node

The **Delay** node inserts a delay into the Sound Node chain to cause a pause before the input sound is passed to the output. The amount of the delay is a random value between the **Delay Min** and **Delay Max** values specified in the **Details** panel.

![Delay Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/86572586-623c-403d-a6a4-1ac05456a06f/delay-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Delay Min | Sets the lower bound of time in seconds for the pause. |
| Delay Max | Sets the upper bound in seconds. |

## Dialogue Player Node

The **Dialogue Player** node is a way to set up a **Dialogue Wave** asset to be played under specific conditions.

Since Dialogue Waves are expected to be used purely for spoken dialogue, the Dialogue Player node requires that you specify both the speaker and the targets of the dialogue being played. This allows the Dialogue Wave to play the correct audio Asset depending on the specific context, such as plurality, gendered language, or for localization purposes.

![Dialogue Player Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/52f20f84-1244-4e67-b849-6b8e8ec91e63/dialogue-player-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dialogue Wave | The Dialogue Wave that the node will play. Click the dropdown to browse for the Asset you want to use. |
| Context | Who is speaking, and to whom. Note that this can only be used once a valid Dialogue Wave is entered. |
| Looping | When enabled, the dialogue will play on a loop. |

## Doppler Node

The **Doppler** node simulates a Doppler effect, in which a sound's pitch changes based on the source's movement in relation to the listener. The pitch will increase as the source approaches the listener and will decrease as the source moves away.

A common real world example of this is the sound of a passing ambulance's siren.

![Doppler Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/9e01982a-2e5d-4b0f-afb7-cae25fed41da/doppler-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Doppler Intensity | A multiplier value for how strongly the Doppler effect is heard. Increase the value to make the effect more pronounced. |
| Use Smoothing | When enabled, the node performs a smooth interpolation on the Doppler effect. |
| Smoothing Interp Speed | The speed at which the pitch scale is interpolated. |

## Enveloper Node

The **Enveloper** node creates an envelope where a sound's volume and pitch are manipulated over a specified time period via distribution curves. These curves can be edited using the embedded **Curve Editors**, or can be based on curves defined in an existing Float Curve Asset already in the **Content Browser**.

Optionally, the envelope can be set to loop a set number of times or even indefinitely.

You can use the properties in the **Modulation** category to randomize predefined values across set points on the envelope.

![Enveloper Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/d244d3c8-cc30-4398-9e7b-3083214064f7/enveloper-sound-node.png)

| Loop Start | The time in seconds where the envelope's loop begins. |
| Loop End | The time in seconds where the envelope's loop ends. |
| Duration After Loop | The time in seconds it takes the envelope to fade out after the last loop is completed. |
| Loop Count | The number of times the envelope will loop if looping is enabled and the envelope is not set to loop indefinitely. |
| Loop Indefinitely | If enabled, the envelope will continue to loop indefinitely regardless of **Loop Count** value. |
| Loop | If enabled, the envelope will loop using the specified loop settings. |
| **Envelope** | Â  |
| Volume Curve | The distribution curve that defines the volume envelope. This can be set directly in the **Details Panel** or to an external curve by clicking on the triangle beside the parameter name and using the expanded **External Curve** parameter options. |
| Pitch Curve | The distribution curve that defines the pitch envelope. This can be set directly in the **Details Panel** or to an external curve by clicking on the triangle beside the parameter name and using the expanded **External Curve** parameter options. |
| **Modulation** | Â  |
| Pitch Min | The minimum pitch for the input sound. |
| Pitch Max | The maximum pitch for the input sound. |
| Volume Min | The minimum volume for the input sound. |
| Volume Max | The maximum volume for the input sound. |

## Group Control Node

The **Group Control** node controls which sounds are played based on the number of active sounds, while giving priority to the first available group.

Initially, this node has two input pins. You may add more pins by clicking the **Add input** button on the node or remove pins by right-clicking them and selecting "Delete Input" from the context menu.

![Group Control Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/3e34c73a-77f6-4cde-8619-6d14c2d1a8c0/group-control-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Group Sizes | The maximum number of Sound Wave sources allowed for each group, minus 1 (the first Sound Wave Node is node **0**). |

## Looping Node

The **Looping** node is used to loop sound indefinitely or a set number of times.

You can loop multiple audio files independently when used in conjunction with the **Mixer** node.

![Looping Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/5c4380fa-23b5-442b-8e59-287358746d85/looping-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Loop Count | The number of times to loop the input sound. This can only be edited if the **Loop Indefinitely** option is disabled. |
| Loop Indefinitely | When enabled, loop indefinitely regardless of the **Loop Count** value. |

A **Looping** node should only be used for logical or procedural looping such as introducing a delay because these sounds will not play seamlessly. If you want a sound to loop seamlessly and indefinitely, use the **Looping** flag on the **Wave Player** node (see below) for the sound.

## Mature Node

With the **Mature** node, you can flag input nodes as intended for mature audiences. This node uses the value of `UEngine:bAllowMatureLanguage` to determine whether input nodes should be played.

Initially, this node has two input pins. You may add more pins by clicking the **Add input** button on the node or remove pins by right-clicking them and selecting "Delete Input" from the context menu.

![Mature Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/a8b73894-ffd3-41da-bf6f-2dfc225ccd5c/mature-sound-node.png)

## Mixer Node

The **Mixer** node defines how concurrent sounds in a Sound Cue are mixed together by providing volume control for each individual input.

Initially, this node has two input pins. Add more pins by clicking **Add input**.

![Mixer Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/32616e53-0948-4536-a439-874cb43c88d8/mixer-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Input Volume | The list of volumes to use for each of the input sounds, allowing normalization with different source volumes. The topmost input is represented by index 0 and each additional input is incremented in order. |

## Modulator Node

The **Modulator** node is used to randomize volume and pitch modulation. You can set maximum and minimum values to determine the range of randomization. When the Sound Cue is triggered, it randomly selects a value within that range.

To set a consistent level for volume or pitch, set the same values for both the minimum and maximum values. This node can also be used to adjust relative volumes of multiple Sound Wave nodes contained within a Sound Cue.

If the **Modulator** node is used in combination with the **Looping** node, it will randomize on the each **Sound Cue** trigger and not on each individual loop.

![Modulator Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/a3ee093e-8732-4c60-a9e0-6be1c839e142/modulator-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pitch Min | Sets the minimum pitch for the input sound. |
| Pitch Max | Sets the maximum pitch for the input sound. |
| Volume Min | Sets the minimum volume for the input sound. |
| Volume Max | Sets the maximum volume for the input sound. |

## Oscillator Node

The **Oscillator** node is used to introduce continuous pitch and volume oscillation. This is useful when looping sounds to create a greater degree of ongoing movement.

By setting maximum and minimum values, you can determine the range of randomization.

![Oscillator Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/ca8dcb2a-5e85-44e4-8b4f-637105eee618/oscillator-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Modulate Volume | Enables volume modulation. |
| Modulate Pitch | Enables pitch modulation. |
| Amplitude Min | The minimum amplitude of the sine wave's modulation, centered around the value set by Center Min and Center Max. For example, an amplitude of 0.25 would oscillate between 0.75 and 1.25. |
| Amplitude Max | The maximum amplitude of the sine wave's modulation, centered around the value set by Center Min and Center Max. For example, an amplitude of 0.25 would oscillate between 0.75 and 1.25. |
| Frequency Min | The minimum frequency of the sine wave's modulation, with the value divided by two to equal to the hertz rate. For example, a frequency of 20 would oscillate at 10Hz. |
| Frequency Max | The maximum frequency of the sine wave's modulation, with the value divided by two to equal to the hertz rate. For example, a frequency of 20 would oscillate at 10Hz. |
| Offset Min | The minimum offset value into the sine wave, commonly called phase. The value entered here will be multiplied by 2Ï€. |
| Offset Max | The maximum offset value into the sine wave, commonly called phase. The value entered here will be multiplied by 2Ï€. |
| Center Min | Both Center Min and Center Max default to 0. Because the default is 0 (not 1), if the amplitude is .2, the sample will be multiplied between -.2 and .2 (instead of .8 and 1.2). |
| Center Max | See Center Min. |

## Quality Level Node

By default, there are no quality levels; the designer must add them to the Project Settings for the node inputs to populate. Once populated, node branching can be used to switch between various levels of SoundCue graph complexity. This provides a way for designers to use simpler SoundCue graphs for lower-powered platforms.

![Quality Level Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/9886e3a8-b0e8-4fbf-bc7c-8848dbf910f6/quality-level-sound-node.png)

The **Quality Level** node uses `GameUserSettings AudioQualityLevel` (or the editor override) to choose which branch to play.

At runtime, this node will only load into memory the Sound Waves connected to the branch that is selected.

## Random Node

The **Random** node is used to randomly trigger a node from the list of connected input nodes. Weight values control the probability of a node being triggered relative to the other nodes connected to the Random node.

When an input node is selected randomly, the Sound Cue will play the entire data flow of that selected input.

Initially, this node has two input pins. You may add more pins by clicking the **Add input** button on the node or remove pins by right-clicking them and selecting "Delete Input" from the context menu.

![Random Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/acbdb0fe-782b-4db2-9a17-a8c213b66e15/random-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Weights | The list of weights for each input sound that determines the odds that a particular sound will be chosen. Each item in the Array can be assigned its own weight value. |
| Preselect at Level Load | If greater than 0, then upon each level load the specified number of inputs will be randomly selected and the rest will be removed. This can be used to cut down the memory usage of large randomizing cues. This setting does not apply during Play In Editor or Simulate; it applies only in game builds outside of Unreal Editor. |
| Should Exclude from Branch Culling | If set to true, this node will not be culled on load for platforms with a maximum amount of preloaded random branches set in the project settings. |
| Randomize Without Replacement | When enabled, the entire list of Sound Nodes will be exhausted before repeating a sound. |

## SoundClass Node

The **SoundClass** node provides a way to remap which **Sound Class** asset used with the input node.

For more information about named parameters, see the [Named Parameters](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-reference-for-unreal-engine#namedparameters) section of this page.

![SoundClass Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/ca9b115b-0cbe-48c8-a7d0-f38d9d3fdbad/soundclass-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sound Class Override | The Sound Class Asset that will override the current Sound Class for the input node. |

## Switch Node

The **Switch** node selects an input node based on the value of a runtime integer parameter. The specified parameter must be declared in either code or Blueprints.

Initially, this node has four input pins. You may add more pins by clicking the **Add input** button on the node or remove pins by right-clicking them and selecting "Delete Input" from the context menu.

For more information about named parameters, see the [Named Parameters](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-reference-for-unreal-engine#namedparameters) section of this page.

![Switch Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/2b40cfa7-42b1-4785-aa57-9a784e18e52d/switch-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Switch** | Â  |
| Int Parameter Name | The name of the integer parameter that determines which input is used. |

## Wave Param Node

The **Wave Param** node uses a named parameter to determine whether to play a different Sound Wave than the one feeding into the input pin. If the specified parameter is set to the name of a valid Sound Wave asset, that asset is played.

If an optional input node is connected and the named parameter is valid, the Wave Param will override the input node when the Sound Cue is played.

For more information about named parameters, see the [Named Parameters](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sound-cue-reference-for-unreal-engine#namedparameters) section of this page.

A potential use for this node would be to play dynamic dialogue lines in between static blip sounds in order to simulate dialogue over a radio. In this way, the same Sound Cue can be reused to great effect.

![Wave Param Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/e465f02d-cd01-470d-bf21-0521439ae5d2/wave-param-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Wave Parameter Name | The name of the Sound Wave asset to play. If the Sound Wave asset specified does not exist, then the input node is evaluated to determine which sound to play instead. |

## Wave Player Node

The **Wave Player** node contains a reference to a Sound Wave asset to be played with the Sound Cue.

![Wave Player Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/05989665-9a36-4a3b-8ab5-c1b12bfd0f89/wave-player-sound-node.png) ![Looping Wave Player Sound Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/8400c770-fce5-490f-a768-48416573dcbd/looping-wave-player-sound-node.png)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sound Wave | The Sound Wave Asset to use in this node. |
| Looping | When enabled, the Sound Wave will play on a loop. Additionally, the node type displayed in the Sound Node Graph will be changed to "Looping Wave Player." |

## Add Comment

Comments can be added anywhere on the Sound Cue. They do not affect the output, but instead are used to call attention to or explain details in the node arrangements or uses.

The comment appears at the top of the frame. There is no limit to the length of the comment.

![Add Comment Box](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/7fbad4a8-47b6-4fbf-8145-e2a9b661d156/add-comment-box.png)

The comment frame's size can be changed by dragging the lines in the lower right corner and the position can be changed by dragging from anywhere else on the frame. Wherever positioned, it will appear behind the nodes.

If you move a comment box, it will bring any fully contained Sound Nodes along with it.

You can also add a comment by selecting multiple nodes, right-clicking a selected node, and then selecting **Create Comment from Selection** from the context menu.

## Examples

Below are examples of more complex Sound Cue arrangements. You can click on each image to expand it.

This Sound Cue plays one sound if a parameter is set to true, and another if it is set to false.

This Sound Cue changes the Sound Classes of the Sound Waves.

This Sound Cue mixes together Sound Waves with a variety of properties, including attenuation, randomization, looping, and delays.
