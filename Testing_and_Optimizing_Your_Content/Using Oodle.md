The **Oodle** suite of cross-platform data compression solutions are now fully integrated with **Unreal Engine**. With Oodle, you can make games smaller to download, make levels load faster, and compress network packets for improved player experience.

There are three different Oodle solutions integrated into Unreal Engine:

-   **Oodle Data**
    
-   **Oodle Network**
    
-   **Oodle Texture**
    

Each Oodle solution can be enabled or disabled independently, using its own plugin. All three are enabled by default in Unreal Engine.

Refer to the individual pages for each Oodle solution for details on how to use them.
