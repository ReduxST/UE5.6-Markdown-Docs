You and others on your team can take measurements within your collaborative view. You can use the **Shift** key to snap a measurement to the x-, y-, or z-axis.

1.  Begin or join your team's collaborative view and move to a position next to the area you want to measure.
    
2.  Open the Interaction Menu. (In desktop mode, press **Spacebar**. In VR mode, press the shoulder buttons on the right-hand controller.)
    
3.  In the Interaction Menu, highlight **Measurement**, then select **Add**.
    
    Click for full image.
    
4.  Select the start point for the measurement, then select the end point for the measurement.

### Measuring Along an Axis (Desktop Mode)

If you want the measurement to snap along the x-, y-, or z-axis, press and hold the **Shift** key as you release the mouse button to place the second end point.

To delete a measurement:

1.  Open the Interaction Menu. (In desktop mode, press **Spacebar**. In VR mode, press the shoulder buttons on the right-hand controller.)
    
2.  Highlight **Measurement**, then select **Delete**.
    
3.  Point your laser at the measurement that you want to delete, then select it.
