## Installing SteamVR

No matter what HMD you are using, if you are developing a VR project that will use SteamVR, you will have to download and install Steam before you can access SteamVR. In the following section, we will go over all you need to know about downloading and installing SteamVR.

1.  First, you will need to download and install the [Steam Client](http://store.steampowered.com/) from the [Steam website](http://store.steampowered.com/).
    
2.  Once Steam had been installed you can launch SteamVR the following two ways:
    
    -   By pressing the Start SteamVR button located at the top of the Steam Client.
