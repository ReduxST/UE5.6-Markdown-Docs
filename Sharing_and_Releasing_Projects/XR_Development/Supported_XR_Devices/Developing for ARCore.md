[ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar) is a [handheld augmented reality](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/developing-for-handheld-augmented-reality-experiences-in-unreal-engine) platform from [Google](https://www.google.com/) that is supported in Unreal Engine. This page describes how ARCore is supported in Unreal Engine, and how to set up your environment to develop with ARCore. Refer to [Supported XR Devices](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/supported-xr-devices-in-unreal-engine) for the full list of which devices and which SDK versions Unreal Engine supports.

## Developing with the ARCore APIs

To develop for ARCore in Unreal Engine you must set up the following:

-   Updated hardware and software. Refer to [Android Development Requirements](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/android-support-for-unreal-engine).
-   Codeworks for Android installed.
-   Android version 26 or greater installed.
-   A supported, configured, and connected handheld Android device.
-   **Google ARCore** plugin enabled in your project.

Once you're set up for developing with ARCore, you can use the unique ARCore functionality to develop for your Android devices. Refer to [Handheld AR Features](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/developing-for-handheld-augmented-reality-experiences-in-unreal-engine#handheldarfeatures) for what features are supported in Unreal Engine.

## Getting Started with Development

After setting up your project with the Google ARCore plugin, follow these guides to get started developing for ARCore devices.

## Profiling

The following guides show how to profile your XR application and what to consider when you need to improve performance.
