This page was written for an earlier version of Unreal Engine and may contain discrepancies with the current version of UE.

This Quick Start guide will walk you through how to set a fixed real-world location in AR to which you can attach virtual content in Unreal. In this example, we will use the HoloLens as our platform.

By following this guide, you will know how to:

-   Save ARPins locally on device.
    
-   Delete local ARPins.
    
-   Load local ARPins.
    

Before getting started, make sure your project is set up for AR. See [Setting Up a New AR Project](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-a-new-ar-project-in-unreal-engine) before continuing.

ARPin Local Storage only works with certain platforms. As of 5.1, the Windows Mixed Reality plugin and some OpenXR extension plugins, such as the Microsoft OpenXR plugin, are supported. See [ARPin](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/arpins-in-unreal-engine) documentation for more information on platform support.

## Step 1 - Adding and Saving ARPins

Follow these steps to spawn a virtual object in 3D space and save its data with ARPin. First, you need to set up the **SpawnActor Function** and then connect it to a **Pin Component** to pin the object to a specific location.

This guide uses the location of the user's hand provided by the HoloLens platform as the spawn location To be able to access the Motion Controller information on HoloLens, follow these steps:

1.  Add the component **Motion Controller** to ARPawn in the Blueprint Editor.
    
    ![Add motion controller component](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/11d6c2f5-de7b-4bc2-b386-ec3070ee691f/01-add-motion-controller_ue5.png)
2.  In the Details panel, set the **Motion Source** to the **Right** hand in order to match the hand that's placing the pins.

### Setting Up the Spawn Actor Function

Follow these steps to set up the Spawn Actor function. This section uses a custom [Blueprint Actor](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/blueprint-class-assets-in-unreal-engine) called **Pin Object** for the virtual content.

1.  Double-click the project's [Pawn](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/pawn-in-unreal-engine) to open it in the **Blueprint Editor**.
    
2.  Add the following functions by right-clicking in the **Event Graph** tab of the Blueprint Editor and searching for the names:
    
    -   Is ARPin Local Store Supported
        
    -   Is ARPin Local Store Ready
        
        Click image to expand.
        
3.  Use the boolean return values from the two functions as input to an **AND** logic node. Connect the result of the AND node to a **Branch** node. This setup makes sure both scenarios are true before executing any ARPin functions.
    
    ![Adding boolean and branch to blueprint](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/e205442c-a011-4431-9f5d-45984c9b7202/04-add-select-blueprint_ue5.png)
4.  From the Branch node, add the **SpawnActor from Class** function. Then, set the node's **Class** parameter to **Pin Object**.
    
5.  Add a **Make Transform** function to specify the local transform where the object will be spawned relative to the spawn position. Keep the default values for the local space because the world transform will be specified later.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
    For details on how to add input actions to your project, see [Input](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/input-in-unreal-engine) for general input actions.
    

### Adding the Pin Component

Follow these steps to pin the object that was spawned in the previous section. The **SpawnActor from Class** function returns an **Object**. However, the **Pin Component** function expects a **Scene Component**. In order to pin the object, grab the object's RootComponent, which is a Scene Component that defines the object's transformation.

1.  Add the function **Pin Component**.
    
2.  Drag the **Return Value** pin from the SpawnActor node and select **Get Root Component**.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
3.  Right-click in the Event Graph and search for the variable that holds the location where you want to pin the object. In order to spawn where your hand is on HoloLens, search for **Get Motion Controller**. Add it to the graph.
    
4.  Pass the variable in as a **Target** to the function **GetWorldTransform**. Then, pass the **Return Value** of the function to the **Pin to World Transform** input of the **Pin Component** node. The world transform defines the world space location the component pins to.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
5.  Add the function **Save ARPin to Local Store** and pass the **ARPin Object Reference**, which is returned by **Pin Component** to the **In Pin** input for the Save ARPin to Local Store node. Make sure each pin has a unique save name. Then, convert the world transform to a **String** to set the save name.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
6.  Run the app on your AR device. When you perform the Select (R) action, the pin object appears and the ARPin Local Store adds an entry for the ARPin.

For HoloLens, you can view all the pins that are saved locally in the Windows Developer Portal. ![Saved pins in Windows Developer Portal](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/5c75a957-fd60-4925-b831-3778865e9b08/image_11.png) 

## Step 2 - Removing ARPins

Follow the steps below to remove ARPins from the local storage and destroy the virtual content associated with them.

1.  Call **Get All Pins** and add a **For Each Loop** node to iterate through the returned array of ARPins.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
2.  Add the function **Remove Pin** to stop updating the pinned component.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
3.  Add the function **Destroy Actor** to remove the virtual pin object. Call **Get Pinned Component** and **Get Owner** to get the Actor from the ARPin and its pinned Scene Component.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
4.  Add the function **Remove All ARPins from Local Store** to remove all the saved pins from the local store after iterating through all the ARPins and destroying their pinned components.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
5.  Run the app on your AR device. When you perform the **Select (L)** action, the pin object disappears and the ARPin Local Store removes the entry for the ARPin.

## Step 3 - Loading ARPins

Follow these steps to load all ARPins saved on the device in a previous session of the app and spawn the virtual content again for the ARPins.

1.  Call **Load ARPins from Local Store** to access all the ARPins that are saved locally on device.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
2.  **Load ARPins from Local Store** returns a map of ARPin names. In order to iterate through the items in the map, convert the map to an array by using the **Values** function. To access every item in the array, add a **For Each Loop** node.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
3.  In the loop body, call **SpawnActor from Class** with a default **Make Transform** function. Use the default values for the transform unless you want to offset the object from where it's going to be spawned.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
4.  Convert the returned object to a **Scene Component** with **Get Root Component** and pass to **Pin Component to ARPin**.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
5.  Run the app on your AR device and create a few ARPins. Restart the app and see all the pins you created previously appear in the same place when the app starts.
    
    ![current pins in AR environment](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/da830a92-7ef5-4910-a280-410f4d9ba08a/image_21.jpg) ![loaded pins in AR environment](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/96c4b35f-b7c7-4e76-bead-c2fb8ba9d6a2/image_22.jpg)
    
    To differentiate the loaded pins from newly created pins, a different material for the object was used.
    

## Step 4 - On Your Own

In this guide, you created ARPins that are stored locally on the device. To create pins that are stored using a cloud computing service such as [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and can be shared between multiple devices and platforms, see Microsoft's documentation for [Azure Spatial Anchors in Unreal Engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unreal/unreal-azure-spatial-anchors).
