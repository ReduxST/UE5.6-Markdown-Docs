OpenXR Stereo Layers send a separate texture to the head-mounted display (HMD) and re-project the texture in a separate rendering pass than the rest of the project. This can be useful for user interface (UI) elements that you want attached to the HMD without additional effects applied to them, such as post-processing or anti-aliasing.
