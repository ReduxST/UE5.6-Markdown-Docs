The Pixel Streaming Infrastructure is the framework used to build custom web players for streaming **Unreal Engine (UE)**. As a separate web application, its source code is located on [its own GitHub repository](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure). This project is updated separately from Unreal Engine, and you should refer to the Pixel Streaming Frontend's GitHub documentation for more information on how to work with it. The links below are legacy pages that direct to relevant portions of the GitHub documentation and provide continuity with previous versions of our documentation.
