**Pixel streaming** for Unreal Engine (UE) works similarly to streaming a video using an online streaming service, except that users can also interact with the application through the streaming interface. UE's pixel streaming system can run a packaged UE application on a desktop PC or a cloud server alongside a small stack of web services. Users can then connect to the pixel streaming application's frontend using a web browser on a desktop machine or mobile device of their choice.

Once connected, users then stream the rendered frames and audio from the remote UE application and interact with it through the frontend, which supports the following types of input:

-   Keyboard.
-   Mouse.
-   Touch input.
-   Custom HTML5 UI created for your player's web page.

Because the frontend is embedded in a web page, users do not need to install or download any additional software to support pixel streaming.

The pages in this section provide instructions and reference guides for deploying and managing your own pixel streaming application with UE.
