## What is Motion Design?

Motion Design is an Internal Editor plugin for broadcasting. You can use it for graphics creation, playout, and real-time data visualization for live television, news, weather, sports production, interstitial graphics, and a variety of other use cases that call for rapid design and animation workflows. The plugin resembles [UMG](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/umg-editor-reference-for-unreal-engine) in its user interface but contains features that are not possible within widgets, for example 3D parametric shapes and a dynamic material builder.

## Enabling the Motion Design Plugins

To use Motion Design, you must first enable the required Motion Design and Storm Sync Motion Design Bridge plugins.

![Enable these Motion Design plugins](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/0d59c97a-4656-4070-b858-efe38eab85c1/image_0.png)

## Create a Motion Design Scene

To create a Motion Design scene, create an empty level or choose from one of the existing level templates:

![Select the Motion Design template](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/251cb934-d80f-4eb4-aa1e-66c64829cdbe/image_1.png)

1.  Go to the **Toolbar** > **Motion Design**, and click the button.
    
    ![The Motion Design button on the Toolbar](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/0cf883c0-80d5-4789-b879-fbff60a5d761/image_2.png)
2.  Go to **Toolbar** > **Motion Design** dropdown, and select **Create Defaults**.
    
    ![The Create Default button](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/d28b2569-7bdc-4ca0-bee5-f26c6fb802eb/image_3.png)
3.  Click **Spawn** to create the configured set of actors.
    
    ![Configure and spawn your default actors](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/685af952-d845-47bd-9090-2065a60f1b09/image_4.png) ![the default actors in the Viewport](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/8a46b516-859a-4200-baf1-b7a86c478a39/image_5.png)

You can also use the Motion Design tools without changing the entire interface by switching to the **Motion Design Mode** in the Modes dropdown. You can activate this Mode by pressing the SHIFT+9 keys on your keyboard.

![Activate Motion Design Mode](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/516da432-185b-4bb4-b723-98cb3684abfd/motion-design-mode.png)

You can delete the scene later. To delete the scene, use the **Deactivate Scene** button in the same drop-down youâ€™ve used earlier. You can also delete the **Default Scene** group manually.

## Motion Design UI Overview

The Motion Design UI has multiple windows that you can use to spawn and manipulate objects.

The UI includes:

-   The Motion Design Tool Box
-   Palettes tabs
-   Sequencer
-   Operator Stack.
-   Motion Design outliner.
-   Motion Design Details panel.
-   A new Viewport utility toolbar under the Viewport.

When a Motion Design Scene is activated, the Motion Design Tool Box opens by default.

![Motion Design UI overview](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/4fda4d1c-110c-47a4-a4af-1526859ae6a4/image_6.png)

In the screenshot above, the colored areas show the following features:

1.  Motion Design Editor Panel Shortcuts
    
    -   Adds navigation selection to reduce the steps to access creative tools such as the **Operator Stack, Remote Control,** and **Material Designer.** It also serves as a central point of contact for the **Transition Logic** system.
2.  Motion Design Toolbox
    
    -   Using this panel, you can place parametric 2D and 3D shapes, text, SVGs, cloners/effectors, and the [Media Plate](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/the-media-plate-actor-in-unreal-engine), as well as many other standard Unreal Engine actor types. The parametric shapes in the 2D and 3D categories are customized for Motion Design, while the **Meshes** category spawns a variety of standard meshes without customization options.
3.  Viewport
    
    -   The default Viewport is still available in the Motion Design UI, with an additional option to zoom in and out on your canvas. To zoom, scroll your mouse wheel. When you select a camera, choose the option named Motion Design Viewport to use this behavior.
4.  Tool Shortcuts
    
    -   This optional panel can house the **Modifier** and **Transition Logic** panels. You can open them through the **Editor Panel Shortcuts** bar (Section 1) by clicking the **Remote Control** and **Material Designer** buttons.
5.  Motion Design Outliner
    
    -   The **Motion Design Outliner** is a customized version of the traditional Unreal Engine Outliner that adds additional functionality, such as **filtering** and **nested groups**. Nested groups have a variety of applications that include offsetting transforms by setting a single **Null Actor** as parent to several actors, and also setting visibility on several actors simultaneously. In addition, you can apply powerful modifiers to a single actor, or multiple actors simultaneously, that are nested under the **Null Actor.**
6.  Sequencer
    
    -   The Sequencer panel has refinements in the Motion Design workflow where multiple sequences can be added and played individually or with logic applied by systems such as **Transition Logic.**
7.  Viewport Utility Toolbar
    
    -   The utility toolbar offers access to a variety of features such as a mask visualization toggle, color picker, screenshot, color channel visualizer (useful for previewing the alpha channel), game mode toggle, bounding box visualization toggle, actor soloing, safe frame toggle, and various snapping tools.
8.  Remote Control
    
    -   Every Motion Design level comes equipped with a linked remote control preset with no assets. In some situations where multiple levels are combined in the Rundown Tool, for example Transition Logic, their respective exposed remote control properties are combined and sorted.

### Motion Design Viewport

![image alt text](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/b0d06914-3124-484a-a1a3-b8d03288b50f/image_7.png)
