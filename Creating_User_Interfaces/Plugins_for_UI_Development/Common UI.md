Common UI provides a toolbox for creating rich, multi-layered user interfaces with cross-platform support, such as those found in Fortnite. Its tools include:

-   A new library of **Common UI Widgets** that provide commonly used game functionality.
-   New **style data assets** that separate styling information from UI elements, making it easier to share styling among multiple UIs.
-   A new **Input Routing** system that can give UI widgets selective interactivity, making it easier to manage focus in multi-layered UIs.
-   Support for console-specific UI elements, such as button icons for a specific controller.
-   Cardinal navigation management for gamepads.

Refer to the pages below for more information about Common UI's intended use cases and how to get started using these tools.
