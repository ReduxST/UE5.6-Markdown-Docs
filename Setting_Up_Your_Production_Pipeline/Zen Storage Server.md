The Zen Storage Server (Zenserver) is designed to support any size project by:

-   Supporting local, shared, or cloud storage
    
-   Offering faster staging and deployment
    
-   Improving cook-time effectiveness by reducing filesystem overhead.
    

Zen streaming is intended for use:

-   On trusted networks like home or office situations.
    
-   With non-shipping build configurations (debug, development, test).
    
-   When the distance between Zenserver (on your workstation) and the target platform (console or mobile device) is low.
