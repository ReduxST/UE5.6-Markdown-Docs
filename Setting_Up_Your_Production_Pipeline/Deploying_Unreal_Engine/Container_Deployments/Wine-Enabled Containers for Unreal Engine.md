Support for containers expands Unreal Engine's capabilities to support new cloud-based development workflows and deployment strategies. You can use Unreal Engine containers to enhance production pipelines, develop next-generation cloud applications, deploy enterprise solutions at unprecedented scale, and much more.

With the addition of the Wine compatibility layer for Linux container images, you can target additional platforms that would otherwise require Windows containers. This brings many benefits including simplified build infrastructure and improved cost effectiveness.

The sections below provide more information about Wine-enabled containers and how to use them in your development pipeline.
