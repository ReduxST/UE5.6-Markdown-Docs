After you have created a Landscape, you can now utilize any of the following tools to customize it:

-   Modify its shape in [Sculpt](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-sculpt-mode-in-unreal-engine) mode.
-   Modify its visual appearance in [Paint](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-paint-mode-in-unreal-engine) mode.
-   Change the size, shape, and type of [Brush](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-brushes-in-unreal-engine) you use to modify the Landscape's shape and appearance.
-   Modify the size and shape of its components in [Manage](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-manage-mode-in-unreal-engine) mode.
-   Copy, paste, import, and export parts of the Landscape's heightmap with [Landscape Gizmos](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-copy-tool-in-unreal-engine).
-   Modify the Landscape's [Material](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-materials-in-unreal-engine).
-   Create [Splines](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-splines-in-unreal-engine) for any linear features you want to use in your Landscape.
-   Create [holes](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/landscape-materials-in-unreal-engine) in your Landscape for features such as caves.
