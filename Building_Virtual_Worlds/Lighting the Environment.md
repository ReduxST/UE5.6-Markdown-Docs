A significant part of building any virtual world is determining how it will be lit. This means being able to efficiently light small enclosed scenes with small lights to large worlds primarily lit by single dominant light source. The engine provides the tools and lighting options necessary to achieve the results your project's demand.

The topics in this page contains information on the the various lighting features and tools available to use, along with guides that create a learning path to the ins and outs of lighting a scene in Unreal Engine.
