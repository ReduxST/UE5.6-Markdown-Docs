## Overview

The **Virtual Scouting tools** give filmmakers ways to navigate and interact in virtual production environments. Directors and Directors of Photography (DOPs) can find locations, compose shots, set up scene blocking, and get accurate representations of filming locations. Artists and set designers can experience the location in Virtual Reality (VR) while building it, using measurement and interaction tools to check distances and modify the world. You can also capture images from the virtual world, helping the whole production team track decisions made during the VR session. In addition, controllers and settings can be customized in Blueprint without the need to go into C++ and rebuild the engine.

Unreal Engineâ€™s Virtual Scouting tools are based on an XR Creative Framework, which provides developers a [toolkit](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/customizing-virtual-scouting-in-unreal-engine) to create headset-based Extended Reality (XR) tools with Blueprints.

The [Virtual Scouting Legacy tools](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/virtual-scouting-legacy-tools) will be sunset and deprecated in a future engine release. We encourage users to move to the new Virtual Scouting tools. Unused VREditor code and modules will be fully deprecated in a future engine release.

## Prerequisites

To use the new tools you must use Unreal Engine 5.4 or higher, on a Windows PC with VR-capable hardware, and one of the following headsets:

-   Meta Quest 2
-   Meta Quest 3
-   Meta Quest Pro
-   Oculus Rift S
-   Valve Index

## Setup

If you meet the prerequisites and want to get started with Virtual Scouting, see [Setting Up Virtual Scouting](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/setting-up-virtual-scouting-in-unreal-engine).
