The **Directional Light** simulates light that is being emitted from a source that is infinitely far away. This means that all shadows cast by this light will be parallel, making this the ideal choice for simulating sunlight. The Directional Light when placed can be set to one of three **Mobility** settings:

-   **Static** - (pictured left) which means that the light cannot be changed in game. This is the fastest method for rendering and allows for baked lighting.
    
-   **Stationary** - (also pictured left) which means the light will only have its shadowing and bounced lighting from static geometry baked by **Lightmass**, all other lighting will be dynamic. This setting also allows for the light to change color and intensity in game, but, it does not move and allows partial baked lighting.
    
-   **Moveable** - (pictured left) which means the light is totally dynamic and allows for dynamic shadowing. This is the slowest in terms of rendering but allows for the most flexibility during gameplay.
    

Below you will see a representation of sunlight being cast through an opening in a roof.

Directional Light Shadow Frustum

The left image shows just the light, the right image has its **Shadow Frustum** enabled in order to see that the Directional Light is casting parallel light rays.

**Light Direction** (pictured left) is indicated by an arrow that points in the direction the light will emit which is useful for placing and orientating your light as needed.

## Directional Light Properties

The properties of a Directional Light are broken up into 5 categories: Light, Light Shafts, Lightmass, Light Function and Cascaded Shadow Maps:

### Light

| Â Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 
**Intensity**

 | 

Total energy that the light emits.

 |
| 

**Light Color**

 | 

The color that the light emits.

 |
| 

**Source Angle**

 | 

Angle subtended by a light source in degrees. Defaults to 0.5357, which is the angle for our sun.

 |
| 

**Source Soft Angle**

 | 

Angle subtended by a soft light source in degrees.

 |
| 

**Use Temperature**

 | 

When disabled, uses white as an illuminant.

 |
| 

**Temperature**

 | 

Color temperature in Kelvin of the blackbody illuminant. White is 6500K.

 |
| 

**Affects World**

 | 

Disables the light completely. Cannot be set at run time. To disable a light's effect during runtime, change its **Visibility** property.

 |
| 

**Cast Shadows**

 | 

If the light casts shadows.

 |
| 

**Indirect Lighting Intensity**

 | 

Scales the indirect lighting contribution from the light.

 |
| 

**Volumetric Scattering Intensity**

**Forward Shading Priority**

 | 

Forward lighting priority for the single directional light that will be used for forward shading, translucent, single layer water and volumetric fog. Then two lights have equal priorities, the selection will be based on their overall brightness as a fallback.

| 

**Modulated Shadow Color**

### Atmosphere and Cloud

Directional Lights support the [Sky Atmosphere](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sky-atmosphere-component-in-unreal-engine) and the [Volumetric Clouds](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/volumetric-cloud-component-in-unreal-engine) features of Unreal Engine.

Additional information and demonstration can be found in the Volumetric Clouds page under the [Directional Light Interactions and Shadowing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/volumetric-cloud-component-in-unreal-engine) section.
