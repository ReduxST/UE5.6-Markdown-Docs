The **Procedural Content Generation Framework (PCG)** is a toolset for creating your own procedural content inside Unreal Engine. PCG provides artists and designers the ability to build fast, iterative tools and content of any complexity ranging from asset utilities, such as buildings or biome generation, up to entire worlds.

The PCG framework is built for extensibility and interactivity, providing easy integration into existing world building pipelines, effectively blurring the lines between procedural and more traditional workflows.
