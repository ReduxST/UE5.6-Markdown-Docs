The Water system enables you to create rivers, lakes, and oceans that all interact and work together with your Landscape terrains using a spline-based workflow. The Water system unifies the shading and mesh rendering pipeline, with surfaces that support physics interactions and fluid simulation with gameplay, such as ripples caused by footsteps or the wake behind a boat moving through the water.

## Enabling the Water System Plugin and Content

The Water system is a self-contained plugin that can be enabled/disabled depending on whether you need it for your project. The plugin enables the rendering and meshing system for water, and also provides example and default content for you to use.

To enable the Water system, use **Edit > Plugins** to open the **Plugins** browser. Search for the **Water** plugin and check its box to enable it.
