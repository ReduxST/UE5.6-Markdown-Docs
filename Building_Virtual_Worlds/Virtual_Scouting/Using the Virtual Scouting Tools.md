The Virtual Scouting tools are similar to editor modes in the [Level Editor](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/level-editor-modes-in-unreal-engine). You can only select one tool at a time, except for the Navigation tool, which is always available.\`

## Main Menu Palette

Use the Main Menu Palette to select tools, adjust the settings of each tool, and undo and redo your actions.

### Controls

To view the Main Menu Palette, pull and hold the trigger on your left motion controller (or right motion controller if you have set handedness to **Left**). The Main Menu stays visible as long as you keep the left trigger pulled.

![Viewing the Main Menu Palette](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/b09e7594-8488-41e6-a6fe-d2c8279c4efe/main-menu-view.gif)

To interact with the Main Menu, use your right motion controller to point with the green cursor and the right motion controller trigger to click and/or drag on the Main Menu UI elements.

### Settings

The Main Menu has the following sections:

-   Section 1: Icons for each tool. Clicking these will switch to the selected tool.
-   Section 2: Each tool's specific settings.
-   Section 3: Undo/Redo and the settings menu.

![Main Menu Palette settings](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/a40bfc12-990a-4d1f-85f4-ee0af8ff69d0/main-menu-settings.png)

## Navigation Toolbar

Use the **Navigation** tool to move around your level. You can adjust settings for movement speed and rotation in the Main Menu Palette.

Navigation is always available while you use other tools. Navigation uses the left controller and sometimes the right controller, depending on whether the selected tool overrides the navigation input controls.

### Controls

The table below lists the controls for navigation.

| Control | Action | Preview |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Right Thumbstick, all directions (pink)** | Fly-in stick direction. | ![VR preview of Fly-in](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/50057705-fb62-42c6-bb22-385a3999f245/fly-in.gif) |
| **Left Thumbstick, on Y-axis (pink)** | Fly-in stick direction. You can use both left and right thumbsticks to fly faster. | Â  |

### Settings

In the Main Menu Palette, you can change the fly and drag speed, whether to use snap-rotate or smooth rotation on the left thumbstick, and whether to use rotation from your wrist's roll axis (forward axis) when teleporting. You can also see a history of times that you've teleported in the scene.

## Draw Tool

Use the **Draw** tool to draw on your scene (Laser Draw), draw in space (Free Draw), and delete your drawings.

### Controls

To draw on the scene, select the draw tool and pull the right trigger. Move the right controller to create a line, and release the trigger to stop drawing.

![VR preview of drawing](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/56556176-a964-4ff3-a320-b7ff287152c2/draw.gif)

![The Draw tool settings](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/3bb4ddf3-eb29-4b53-a826-ae9eac10823f/draw-settings.png)

## Measurement

Use the **Measurement** tool to measure the distance between two points.

### Controls

To create measurements point the laser pointer, pull and hold the trigger and drag from the start position to the end point. The measurement updates as you drag.

![VR preview of measurement](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/25cab771-dec4-4443-b168-fdffe230340b/measurement.gif)

### Settings

In the Main Menu Palette, you can modify the color of your measurements or swap the tool type. Use the **Persistent** type to create measurements that are visible to all users in a multi-user session and remain in the environment after you stop using the measurement tool. Use the **Temporary** type to make measurements that are only visible to you, and are removed as soon as you swap to another tool.

![The Controls tab in the Measurement settings](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/5ac654ee-79d7-467e-941a-2d5a18abeb96/measurement-controls.png)

The Measurement tool **List** tab displays all the measurements currently in the level. For each measurement, you can toggle its visibility, see a line from your location to the measurement, teleport to the measurement, and delete the measurement.

## Environment Light

Use the Environment (**Env**) tool to control the placement of the **Sun** and **Moon** light in your level.

For this placement to work you must have two directional lights in your level and your Sun and Moon must have the following properties set:

-   `Atmosphere Sun Light` = `True`
-   `Atmosphere Sun Light Index` = `0` (for the Sun)
-   `Atmosphere Sun Light Index` = `1` (for the Moon)
-   `Forward Shading Priority` = `0` (for the Sun)
-   `Forward Shading Priority` = `1` (for the Moon)

### Controls

By default, the tool starts with the sun selected. To move the sun, point your laser pointer and pull the right-hand motion controller trigger. Hold the trigger and move your laser pointer, and the sun follows the direction of your pointer.

![VR preview of the Env tool](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/834e01b4-b239-405f-a723-e1275520bd25/sun.gif)

### Settings

In the Main Menu Palette, you can control the properties of the Sun and Moon lights, such as **Intensity**, **Temperature**, **Color**, and **Source Angle**, and also reset the properties to default values.

![The Env tool settings](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/9b958895-6c4d-46f6-b96c-d5b57a77116d/env-settings.png)

## Viewfinder

Use the **Viewfinder** tool to take screenshots of the environment with an on-screen camera. You can control various properties of the shot, such as aperture and focus.

The level sequence opens in the editor and a small console widget appears above your right motion controller.

In a multi-user session, to make the level sequence open for the other users, enable the `Concert.EnableOpenRemoteSequencer` variable.

To close the sequence, click the **Close** button with your laser pointer.

When a sequence is open, you can use the controls in the following table.

In the Main Menu Palette, the Sequencer tool has **Use Collection Filter** set to true by default. Use the setting to curate which Level Sequences are available in Virtual Scouting. If **Use Collection Filter** is set to false, then all Level Sequences in the project are visible to the Sequencer tool.

To create a collection of sequences for Virtual Scouting, follow these steps:

1.  In the Content Browser, go to **Collections** and click the **Add (+)** button.
2.  Name the collection.
3.  Drag some Level Sequences into the collection.

![Settings for the Content Placement tool](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/41627b02-e82d-49fc-95a1-ab17a7796f51/placement-settings.png)

#### Create a Placement Tool Collection

The Placement tool has **Collection Filter** set to **True** by default. Use a named collection to curate what assets are available for placement. If **Collection Filter** is set to **False**, then all mesh assets in the project are visible to the Placement tool.

To create a Placement Tool collection, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Content Browser**, go to **Collections** and click the **Add (+)** button.
2.  Name the collection.
3.  Drag some assets into the collection.

    To learn more about content browser collections, see [Creating Collections](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/filters-and-collections-in-unreal-engine#creatingcollections).
    
4.  In **Project Settings** > **Virtual Scouting Settings**, input the name of your collection into the **Placement Tool Collection** field.
