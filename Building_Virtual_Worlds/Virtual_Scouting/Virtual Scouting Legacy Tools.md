The Virtual Scouting Legacy tools described on this page will be sunset and deprecated in a future engine release. We encourage users to move to the [new Virtual Scouting tools](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/virtual-scouting-in-unreal-engine). Unused VREditor code and modules will be fully deprecated in a future engine release.

The **Virtual Scouting Legacy tools** give filmmakers new ways to navigate and interact in virtual production environments, helping them make better creative decisions. Directors and DOPs can easily find locations, compose shots, set up scene blocking, and get accurate representations of filming locations. Artists and set designers can experience the location in VR while building it, using measurement and interaction tools to check distances and modify the world. You can also capture images from the virtual world, helping the whole production team track decisions made during the VR session. In addition, controllers and settings can be customized in Blueprint without the need to go into C++ and rebuild the engine.
