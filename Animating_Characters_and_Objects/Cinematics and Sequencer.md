Unreal Engine contains robust Cinematic tools enabling you to create animated and cinematic sequences. You can pilot cameras to create level fly-throughs, animate lights, move objects, animate characters, render output sequences, and more. At the core of these workflows is **Sequencer**, a powerful non-linear editing suite. Sequencer is the primary tool you will be using to create Cinematic content in Unreal Engine.

This page contains links to documentation covering Unreal Engine's Cinematic tools and real-world examples of their associated workflows.
