Live Link Hub is a stand-alone application for streaming real time animation data from Motion Capture software into Unreal Engine and UEFN.

It is suitable for both solo users and professional performance capture and virtual production stages using multi-user editor sessions.

It enables you to connect to animation sources, modify and record their data, and stream the data to multiple editor sessions on the same network.

Live Link Hub supplements and augments the Live Link functionality first introduced in Unreal Engine 4.
