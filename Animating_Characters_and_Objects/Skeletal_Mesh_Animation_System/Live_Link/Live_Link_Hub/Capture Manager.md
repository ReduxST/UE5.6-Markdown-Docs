**Capture Manager** in [Live Link Hub](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/live-link-hub-in-unreal-engine) is used to ingest footage captured on a variety of devices including audio, mono and stereo video, and mobile using the **Live Link Face** application. The footage is referred to as a take.

The **Capture Manager Layout** in Live Link Hub replaces the Capture Manager tool that was part of **Unreal Engine**. The original Capture Manager tool will be removed in a future version of Unreal Engine.
