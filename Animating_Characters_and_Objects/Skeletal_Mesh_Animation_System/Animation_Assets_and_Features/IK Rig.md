The **IK Rig** system provides a method of interactively creating **Solvers** that perform pose editing for your skeletal meshes. The resulting IK Rig Asset can then be embedded into any animation systems, such as Animation Blueprints to dynamically modify the pose-based solver parameters.

Additionally, the **IK Retargeting** system can be used to transfer animations between characters of varying proportions, either at runtime or for offline creation of new animation sequences.

This page contains links to documentation covering Unreal Engine's **IK Rig** and **Retargeting** tools, and real-world examples of their workflows.

## IK Rig

**IK Rigs** are the primary Assets you will be using when using the IK Rig system. These pages describe its usage and primary features.

## Retargeting

IK Rigs can also be used as a platform to quickly retarget animations between different skeletons. This page describe this retargeting process using **IK Rigs** and the **IK Retargeter**.

## Animation Blueprint Authoring

IK Rigs can be utilized in **[Animation Blueprints](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animation-blueprints-in-unreal-engine)** to procedurally adjust animations for better alignment. This page describes the features of using **IK Rig** in **Animation Blueprints**.
