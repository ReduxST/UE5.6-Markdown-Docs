Character animations in Unreal Engine are built on the foundation of a **Skeletal Mesh**, a rigged mesh that can be manipulated to create animations. In addition, **Animation Blueprints** can be augmented to Skeletal Meshes to apply logic that governs animation behavior and interactions within levels.

Unreal Engine provides a variety of animation tools to work with Skeletal Meshes to further enhance your animations. This page provides an overview of these primary systems.
