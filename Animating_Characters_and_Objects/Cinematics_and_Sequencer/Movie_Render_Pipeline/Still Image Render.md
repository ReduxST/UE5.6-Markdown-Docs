Movie Render Queue can be used to render still images from multiple cameras as a batch process, without the need for complicated setups in Sequencer. This simplifies the process of creating large series of stills from different viewpoints, as you work through variations or iterations. This is ideal for architectural, automotive, or product design deliverables.

This document provides an overview of the Still Image Setup tool and how it can be used with Movie Render Queue.

#### Prerequisites

-   You have completed the prerequisite steps from the **[Movie Render Queue](/documentation/404)** page.
-   You have placed multiple **[cinematic cameras](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cinematic-cameras-in-unreal-engine)** in your Level, capturing your chosen angles.

## Open Still Image Setup Tool

The Still Image Setup Tool is located within Movie Render Queue's **Plugin Content** folder. In order to access this folder in the **[Content Browser](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/content-browser-in-unreal-engine)**, select **View Options** and enable both **Show Engine Content** and **Show Plugin Content**.

You should now see multiple folders in your Content Browser sidebar. Locate **MovieRenderPipeline Content** and navigate to its **Editor > Stills** subfolder. You should see **StillRenderSetupAutomation** contained within it, which is an **[Editor Utility Widget](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/editor-utility-widgets-in-unreal-engine)**.

Right-click **StillRenderSetupAutomation** and select **Run Editor Utility Widget** to open the tool.

## Tool Usage

To create a sequence of still images using the cameras placed in your Level, click **Create Sequence For All Cameras**. This will create a **[Level Sequence Asset](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-sequencer-movie-tool-overview)** for each **[Cine Camera Actor](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cinematic-cameras-in-unreal-engine)** that is placed in this Level.

The sequences are created within the folder path determined by the **Sequence Creation Path** property, and are named according to their assigned camera.

You can also click **Create Sequence For Selected**, which will only create sequences for selected cameras.

If **Automatically Add Jobs to Movie Queue** is enabled, then when you open the MRQ window, you should see your sequences already added to the queue.

Click **Render (Local)** to create a single image render from your different cameras.

When rendering, it is recommended that you add some amount of warm up time in order to allow your assets and textures to fully load at their maximum quality. You can do this by setting the **Engine Warm Up** property to a value of at least **60**. This property is located in the **[Anti-Aliasing](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cinematic-rendering-image-quality-settings-in-unreal-engine#anti-aliasing)** image setting.

## Still Settings

The following buttons and properties are available in the **Sequencer Still Setup** window.
