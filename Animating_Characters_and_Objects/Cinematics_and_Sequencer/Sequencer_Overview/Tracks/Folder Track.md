Folder tracks in Sequencer are used to organize your content and other tracks within custom folders. This page provides an overview of how to create and use Folder tracks.

#### Prerequisites

-   You have an understanding of **[Sequencer](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/how-to-make-movies-in-unreal-engine)** and its **[Interface](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/sequencer-cinematic-editor-unreal-engine)**.

## Creation

The most common way to create a Folder track is by clicking **Add Track (+)** in Sequencer and selecting **Add Folder**.

Folders can also be created by right-clicking a single or group of tracks and selecting **Move to Folder > New Folder**. Doing this will create a new Folder track and move the selected tracks under it.

You can also select one or several tracks and press **Ctrl + G** on your keyboard. This will create a new folder and move the selected tracks under it.

Right-clicking a folder and selecting **Add Folder** will also create a subfolder on that Folder track.

## Usage

Folder Tracks support a wide range of intuitive movement and organization operations.

### Renaming

Like most top-level tracks, folders can be renamed by triple-clicking the track text, by right-clicking and selecting **Rename**, or by pressing **F2**.

### Add to Folder

Tracks can be added to folders by dragging them onto a folder in the Sequencer Outliner.

They can also be added to any currently existing folders by right-clicking them and selecting the folder from the **Move to Folder** menu.

### Remove from Folder

Tracks can be removed from folders by right-clicking them and selecting **Remove from Folder**.

### Setting Folder Color

You can apply colors to each Folder track's icon to distinguish them from one another.

To do this, right-click the folder and select **Set Color**. A Color Picker window will appear from which you can select your color. Once a color is selected, click the **OK** button and your folder icon will be updated with the selected color .
