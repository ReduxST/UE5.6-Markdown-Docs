Unreal Engine provides a suite of animation tools for you to rig and animate characters directly in-engine, called Control Rig. Using Control Rig, you can bypass the need to rig and animate in external tools, and instead animate in Unreal Editor directly. With this system, you can create and rig custom controls on a character, animate in **[Sequencer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cinematics-and-movie-making-in-unreal-engine)**, and use a variety of other animation tools to aid your animating process.

This page contains links to documentation covering Unreal Engine's Control Rig tools and real-world examples of their workflows.

## Starting Out

If you're just starting to learn about animating within Unreal Engine, this page gives a quick overview of how to create and animate a basic Control Rig.
