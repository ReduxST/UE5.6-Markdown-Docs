This is what you'll see at the end of this tutorial.

If you are brand new to the **Unreal Engine** (UE), you will probably want to read [Programming Quick Start](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-cpp-quick-start) before starting this tutorial. That guide gives some good insight into using C++ in UE for seasoned programmers and new users alike.

If you have already been exposed to C++ in UE, but you are still not sure how to create a Pawn class or configure input, the [Player Input and Pawns](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/quick-start-guide-to-player-input-in-unreal-engine-cpp) tutorial is a great place to start learning the C++ concepts and skills you will need to get started.

## Goals

The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to build a basic First Person Shooter (FPS) using C++.

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

-   Set up a Project
