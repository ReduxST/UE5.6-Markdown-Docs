The **Content Examples** project is designed as a showcase of different technology available to you in Unreal Engine (UE). The project is set up as a collection of levels, with each level teaching a different aspect of the engine. As you move through the level, you will see a series of numbered stands that have its own example asset.

Content examples are designed to be an interactive method of learning. For some of them, you must play the level in order to interact with the assets.

Open any examples within the Content Example levels, change or edit them, make your own versions of them, and learn from how they were assembled. You may also use any of the examples in your own levels.

## Installing the Content Examples Sample Project

To create a project with the Content Examples sample project, follow these steps:

1.  Access the [Content Examples sample](https://fab.com/s/d435deb8d960) from **Fab** and click **Add to My Library** for the project file to show in the **Epic Games Launcher**.
    1.  Alternatively, you can search for the sample project from the Fab plugin for UE.
