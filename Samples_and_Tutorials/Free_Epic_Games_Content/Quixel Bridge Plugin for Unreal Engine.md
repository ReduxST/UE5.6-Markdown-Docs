## Adding Assets to Your Project

There are a couple of ways to download and add assets to your UE project.

1.  Drag and Drop.
2.  Download and Add to Scene.

These two methods are described further in the following sections.

### Drag & Drop

You can drag and drop a single asset or multiple assets together into your scene.

To add an asset to your scene, select the asset in the Bridge panel. Drag it into the viewport.

Click image for full size.

If the asset has not previously been downloaded, this will automatically initiate download. It will download the resolution specified in the asset's information panel.

While the asset is downloading, a preview of the asset will appear in your scene. This preview is a placeholder until the full asset finishes downloading.

If this is the first time you are downloading something in Bridge for Unreal Engine, the following new folders are created in your Content browser.

-   **Megascans**: this is where the assets are saved inside your UE project.
-   **MSPresets**: this contains all the template master materials that are used to render the downloaded assets in your scene.

Once the final asset has been downloaded, it will replace the preview in the scene.

All surfaces, imperfections, and decals appear on a spherical mesh when dragged and dropped into the viewport.

### Download and Add to Scene

You can also download then add assets to your scene in two separate steps.

#### Download to Project

One way to download an asset is to hover over the asset in the grid, then click the green **Quick Download** button.
