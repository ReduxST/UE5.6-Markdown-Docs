The Renderer module in the engine manages and renders scenes, which hold the renderable information associated with each world. It includes the definition of all drawing policies and shader.

The RHI module, which is the interface for rendering APIs, is another key module for graphics programming. The [Graphics Programming Overview](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/graphics-programming-overview-for-unreal-engine) covers many key classes, settings, and variables to investigate, while the other subpages below cover specific rendering topics.
