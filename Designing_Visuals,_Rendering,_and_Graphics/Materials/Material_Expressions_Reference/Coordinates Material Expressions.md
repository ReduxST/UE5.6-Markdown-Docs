## ActorPositionWS

**ActorPositionWS** outputs Vector3 (RGB) data representing the location of the object with this material on it in world-space.

![Actor Position WS expression](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/53445aab-229e-434d-b74d-d05eead79c52/actor-position-ws.png)

In this example, ActorPositionWS is passed directly into the Base Color of the Material. As a result, each of the objects with the Material applied to them show a different color as they are moved to different locations in 3D space. Note that the result of the ActorPositionWS node is being divided by 1600 to create a nice blend-in color, rather than an abrupt pop.

## CameraPositionWS

The **CameraWorldPosition** expression outputs a three-channel vector value representing the camera's position in world space.

In the example below, Camera Position is passed into the base color of the Material. Note how the preview sphere changes color as the camera position changes.

## LightmapUVs

The **LightmapUVs** expression outputs the lightmap UV texture coordinates in the form of a two-channel vector value. If lightmap UVs are unavailable, it will output a two-channel vector value of (0,0).

## ObjectOrientation

The **ObjectOrientation** expression outputs the world-space up vector of the object on which the Material is applied. In other words, the object's local positive z-axis is pointing in this direction.

## ObjectPositionWS

The **ObjectPositionWS** expression outputs the world-space center position of the object's bounds. Each sphere in the image below displays a different color as they are moved to a different position in space. The RGB color channels correspond to the X, Y and Z axes in the level. This node is useful when creating spherical lighting for foliage.

## ObjectRadius

The **Object Radius** outputs a value equal to the radius of a given object in Unreal units. Scaling is taken into account and the results can be unique for each individual object.

![Object Radius expression](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/2379a28c-bdc8-4628-98b7-7897587d4ffb/object-radius.png)

In this example, both meshes are receiving this material in which the ObjectRadius is fed into Diffuse. The ObjectRadius output is being divided by 512 to provide a more meaningful visual result.

## Panner

The **Panner** expression outputs UV texture coordinates that can be used to create panning, or moving, textures.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Properties |   |
| **SpeedX** | Specifies the speed to pan the coordinates in the U direction. |
| **SpeedY** | Specifies the speed to pan the coordinates in the V direction. |
| Inputs |   |
| **Coordinate** | Takes in base UV texture coordinates the expression can then modify. |
| **Time** | Takes in a value used to determine the current panning position. This is usually a [Time](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/constant-material-expressions-in-unreal-engine#time) expression to provide a constant panning effect, but a [Constant](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/constant-material-expressions-in-unreal-engine#constant) or [Scalar Parameter](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/material-parameter-expressions-in-unreal-engine#scalarparameter) can be used as well to set a specific offset or to control the panning through Matinee or Blueprints. |

Panner generates UVs that change according to the Time input. The Coordinate input can be used to manipulate (e.g. offset) the UVs generated by the Panner node.

## ParticlePositionWS

The **ParticlePositionWS** expression outputs Vector3 (RGB) data representing each individual particle's position in world space.

![Particle Position WS example](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/f95e3f5e-95d9-481a-8cb5-5d61fd1c7387/particle-position-worldspace.png)

In this image, ParticlePositionWS is being fed into emissive color to visualize the data. The particle system has been scaled up to show how the color is changing based on position.

## PixelNormalWS

The **PixelNormalWS** expression outputs vector data representing the direction that pixels are facing based on the current normal.

![Pixel Normal WS Example](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/d20e157e-d161-48f9-9b87-db886d169f68/pixel-normal-ws.png)

In this example, PixelNormalWS is fed into Base Color. Notice how the normal map is used to give the per-pixel result.

## Rotator

The **Rotator** expression outputs UV texture coordinates in the form of a two-channel vector value that can be used to create rotating textures.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Properties |   |
| **CenterX** | Specifies the U coordinate to use as the center of the rotation. |
| **CenterY** | Specifies the V coordinate to use as the center of the rotation. |
| **Speed** | Specifies the speed to rotate the coordinates clockwise. |
| Inputs |   |
| **Coordinate** | Takes in base UV texture coordinates the expression can then modify. |
| **Time** | Takes in a value used to determine the current rotation position. This is usually a [Time](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/constant-material-expressions-in-unreal-engine#time) expression to provide a constant rotation effect, but a [Constant](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/constant-material-expressions-in-unreal-engine#constant) or [Scalar Parameter](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/material-parameter-expressions-in-unreal-engine#scalarparameter) can be used as well to set a specific offset or to control the rotation through Matinee or Blueprints. |

## SceneTexelSize

The **SceneTexelSize** expression allows you to offset by texel sizes, as you would when using the SceneColor and SceneDepth expressions. This is useful for edge detection in multi-resolution systems, as without this calculation you would be forced to use a small static value, resulting in inconsistent results at lower resolutions.

## ScreenPosition

The **ScreenPosition** expression outputs the screen-space position of the pixel currently being rendered.

![Screen Position example](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/66d94280-5480-40c9-bd87-cee44bb44fc1/screen-position.png)

## TextureCoordinate

The **TextureCoordinate** expression outputs UV texture coordinates in the form of a two-channel vector value allowing materials to use different UV channels, specify tiling, and otherwise operate on the UVs of a mesh.

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Properties |   |
| **Coordinate Index** | Specifies the UV channel to use. |
| **UTiling** | Specifies the amount of tiling in the U direction. |
| **VTiling** | Specifies the amount of tiling in the V direction. |
| **Un Mirror U** | If *true*, undo any mirroring in the U direction. |
| **Un Mirror V** | If *true*, undo any mirroring in the V direction. |

**Example Usage:** To access the second UV channel of a mesh, create a TextureCoordinate node, set its CoordinateIndex to 1 (0 - first channel, 1 - second channel, etc), and connect it to the UVs input of a TextureSample node.

![Texture Coordinate Example](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/c3603e4b-e9c4-463c-bda9-dc086b8fbe17/texture-coordinates.png)

## VertexNormalWS

The **VertexNormalWS** expression outputs the world-space vertex normal. It can only be used in material inputs that are executed in the vertex shader, like WorldPositionOffset. This is useful for making a mesh grow or shrink. Note that offsetting position along the normal will cause the geometry to split apart along UV seams.

In the example above, the preview sphere would seem to scale up and down with sinusoidal motion, as each of the vertices moved in their own normal directions.

## VertexTangentWS

The **VertexTangentWS** expression outputs the world-space vertex tangents. Like VertexNormalWS, this is useful for manipulating the vertex positions of a mesh to produce subtle ambient animation through the **World Position Offset** input.

In the above example, each vertex on the sphere moves in a sinusoidal motion along the vertex tangent in world space. This gives an impression that the sphere is twisting to the left and right. On the plane, it causes the plane to wobble left and right along the vertex tangents.

## ViewSize

The **ViewSize** expression outputs a 2D vector giving the size of the current view in pixels. This is useful for causing various changes in your materials based on the current resolution of the screen.

In this example, ViewSize is connected to Base Color and the result is divided by 2,400 to make the result more visible. When the size of the preview window increases or decreases, the color of the sphere changes.

## WorldPosition

The **WorldPosition** expression outputs the position of the current pixel in world space. To visualize, simply plug the output into Emissive:

![World Position Example](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/d5e55e3e-dda4-4eb5-89c6-7b2ec146afc4/world-position.png)

Common uses are to find the radial distance from the camera to a pixel (as opposed to the orthogonal distance from PixelDepth). WorldPosition is also useful to use as a texture coordinate and have unrelated meshes using the texture coord match up when they are near each other. Here is a basic example of using WorldPosition.xy to planar map a texture:

![Planar projection WS](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/53392e88-6c44-4779-8b5a-c16e05f602ab/world-position-planar.png)
