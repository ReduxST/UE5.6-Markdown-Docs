**Materials** are created using a specialized coding language called **High Level Shading Language** or HLSL. HLSL allows Materials to send instructions directly to the graphics hardware, giving artists and coders control over what is displayed on screen. Inside Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) the **Material Expression** nodes that are used to create Materials contain small snippets of this HLSL code.

The inputs on the **Main Material Node** are the last stop in a UE5 Material graph. Whatever combination of Material Expression nodes is connected to the inputs on the Main Material Node is what determines the overall appearance of the final Material when it is compiled and used in your Level.

![UE5 Main Material Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/4d10e4fe-111a-4a32-b150-fa25bbe06453/main-material-node-ue5.png)

The Main Material Node with default inputs.

## Material Inputs

Each **input** on the Main Material Node defines a single unique aspect of the appearance and surface properties of your Material. For example, if you connect a **Constant3Vector** to the **Base Color** input and give it a value of (1,0,0), you can make the Material red.

![Vector 3 in Base Color](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/53baddc5-8cf3-4408-b73f-c4eb595b4ee4/base-color.png)

This Material graph only explicitly defines a single aspect of the Materialâ€”its Base Color.

However, the overall appearance of the Material is the collective result of all the enabled inputs in the Main Material Node. Enabled input pins are white on the Main Material Node, and disabled inputs are grayed out.

![Enabled inputs in Main Material Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/4a947be3-2c18-4840-9932-b1f4fdf22ff8/active-inputs.png)

Inputs that do not receive any data from Material expressions in the graph simply revert to their default values. For example, even though there is nothing plugged into Metallic, Specular, or Roughness, these properties still contribute to the appearance of the Material.

![Empty material inputs](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/a67964db-9463-4d62-9738-bd7a085f1fe8/empty-inputs.png)

-   **Metallic** defaults to 0 (non-metallic).
-   **Specular** defaults to 0.5.
-   **Roughness** defaults to 0.5.

Therefore, a Material with those values plugged into Metallic, Specular, and Roughness looks exactly the same as the one shown previously.

  ![Default values](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/e296cabd-a72a-4e72-be5d-688be71d2d7e/default-no-inputs.png) ![Default Spec Metallic Roughness](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/42c8a0ae-2102-48ed-ae61-3d95560fc5f1/default-spec-metallic-roughness.png) ![New values in color and roughness](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/1ff62541-d032-4d02-a238-26232ed12f43/new-values.png)

Slider: Note that the preview render does not change when default values are connected the the Main Material Node.

By changing the values, you can alter the appearance and surface properties of the Material. In the third image, the roughness value is changed from **0.5 to 0.07**, and the Material appears more polished. Changing the values in the **Constant3Vector** to **(0,0,1)** makes the Base Color blue instead of red.

### Understanding Material Inputs

UE5 uses a **Physically Based Rendering** (PBR) workflow for Materials, meaning Materials closely approximate the way surfaces interact with light in the real world. To create Materials effectively it is important to understand exactly how each input affects the final Material. These two pages provide foundational information about the PBR Materials workflow in Unreal Engine 5.

-   Read the [Physically Based Materials](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/physically-based-materials-in-unreal-engine) overview to learn best practices for creating Materials in a PBR workflow.
-   Read the [Material Inputs](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/material-inputs-in-unreal-engine) page for examples and descriptions of what each input on the Main Material Node does.

### Enabled and Disabled Inputs

Some of the input pins in the Main Material Node are enabled by default, while others are disabled. The following properties in the **Details Panel** determine which inputs are enabled.

-   Material Domain
-   Blend Mode
-   Shading Model

![Default Main Material Node](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/af693307-51cd-451d-8537-8839f389eeec/enabled-inputs.png)

Modifying any of these three Material properties can change the inputs that are enabled and disabled in the Main Material Node.

In the middle example, changing the Blend Mode from **Opaque** to **Translucent** enables the Opacity and Refraction inputs. It also disables any inputs that are not used by translucent Materials.

![Main Material Node variations](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/f7c0d207-5a2c-4294-bca6-15c0561753c2/main-mat-node-variations.png)

On the far right, selecting the **Clear Coat Shading Model** enables the inputs for Clear Coat and Clear Coat Roughness.

You must select the Main Material Node to access these properties in the **Details** panel. To select the Main Material Node, click it with the **left mouse button** or click anywhere in the background of the Material graph.

### Nodes Connected to Disabled Inputs are Ignored

When switching between Blend Modes or Shading Models, some inputs may become disabled. Material Expressions remain connected to disabled inputs, but are ignored when the Material is compiled.

In this example, a constant value was connected to Opacity. The Blend Mode was changed from **Translucent** to **Opaque**, causing the Opacity input to become disabled.

![Opacity disabled](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/c6055e10-30f6-4adc-9346-d597514e32d8/opacity-ignored.png)

The constant node remains connected to the Opacity input, but the cable and input are grayed out to indicate that the input is disabled. Nodes connected to disabled inputs do not affect the compiled Material in any way.

## Main Material Node Details Panel Properties

When the Main Material Node is selected in the Material Editor, the **Details** panel displays a list of all editable properties relating to how the Material can be used.

As demonstrated above, properties like **Blend Mode** and **Shading Model** directly influence which inputs are enabled in the Main Material Node. Other sections let you modify how the Material interacts with specific platforms or rendering features.

Here is a brief breakdown of what each section in the Main Material Node Details panel does:

## Using the Main Material Node

Inputs on the Main Material Node work exactly like any other Material Expression or Function in the Material graph.

To connect a Material Expression to an input in the Main Material Node:

1.  **Left-click** the output pin of a Material Expression and drag the mouse to an input pin on the Main Material Node.
    
    ![Drag connection](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/f4b75033-fd24-4678-b05a-caa2af7efdc2/drag-connection.png)
2.  Release the **left mouse button** over the input pin when the green check icon appears.

## Previewing and Applying Materials

The Main Material node is the end-point of a UE5 Material graph. The information that you pass into the inputs on the Main Material node is what ultimately determines the appearance of the Material. As you connect Material expressions to the Main Material node, the preview in the Material Editor viewport updates continuously so you can evaluate your changes and make sure you are getting the desired results.
