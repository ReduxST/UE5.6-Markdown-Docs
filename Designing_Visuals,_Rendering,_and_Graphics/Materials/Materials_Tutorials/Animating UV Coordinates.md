The ability to add motion to your Materials is a vital skill, as it provides a way to recreate effects such as fire, water, or smoke. A very cheap and effective way to do this is to use the **Panner Material Expression** node. The Panner node generates UV coordinates that change over time, moving textures in either the U or V direction, or in a combination of both.

## What is Animating UV Coordinates

Animating UV coordinates or UV panning means to move a texture's UV coordinates either horizontally (in the U direction), or vertically (in the V direction), to give the illusion that complex animation is taking place. In the following example, the **T\_Fire\_Tiled\_D** texture from the Starter Content is panning in the U direction (horizontally), making the fire look like it is moving.

## Panner Node Breakdown

You can add a **Panner Material Expression** to the Material Graph by searching for **Panner** in the Palette or right-click context menu. You can also hold down the **P** key and left-click anywhere in the Material Graph to insert a Panner at the mouse pointer. The Panner Material Expression takes two inputs â€” **Coordinates** and **Time.**

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 
**Coordinate**

 | 

Takes in base UV texture coordinates which the expression can then modify.

 |
| 

**Time**

 | 

Takes in a value used to determine the current panning position. This is usually a Time expression to provide a constant panning effect, but you can use a Constant or Scalar Parameter as well to set a specific offset or to control the panning through Blueprints.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 
**Speed X**

 | 

Speed to move the texture coordinates in the horizontal or X direction.

 |
| 

**Speed Y**

 |
| 

**Const Coordinate**

 | 

Only used if Coordinate is not hooked up.

 |
| 

**Fractional Part**

 | 

Output only the fractional part of the pan calculation for greater precision. Output is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.

## How to Animate UV Coordinates in your Material

Use the following steps to create a Material that uses UV panning to animate a texture.

This tutorial uses a texture found in the Unreal Engine **Starter Content.** If you did not include the Starter Content in your project, look at the [Migrating content](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/migrating-assets-in-unreal-engine) page for information about how to move content between projects. This way you can add the Starter Content to your project and not have to make a new one.

1.  First create a new Material. **Right-click** in the Content Browser and select **Material** in the Create Basic Asset section of the context menu.
    
    [![Create Material](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dfc7fe61-a895-44e8-bf7a-d77cbe9c19c9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/dfc7fe61-a895-44e8-bf7a-d77cbe9c19c9?resizing_type=fit)
    
2.  **Double-click** the Material thumbnail in the Content Browser to open it in the Material Editor.
    
    [![Open Material](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8d1c5358-9ebc-406e-8209-c117bb708008?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8d1c5358-9ebc-406e-8209-c117bb708008?resizing_type=fit)
    
3.  In the **Starter Content** folder, search for **T\_Fire.** Left-click and drag the texture **T\_Fire\_Tiled\_D** texture directly into your Material Graph from the Content Browser.
    
    [![Drag fire texture into Material](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cce54bd2-b6a5-4de1-9d35-e682b658f867?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cce54bd2-b6a5-4de1-9d35-e682b658f867?resizing_type=fit)
    
4.  Add a **Panner** Material Expression to your graph. You can hold down the hotkey (**P**) and left-click in the Material Graph, or search for "panner" in the Palette. Your graph should look like this.
    
    [![Panner and texture in Material graph](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d5a4ecda-57c2-4b6a-8649-97b2caa7c64e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d5a4ecda-57c2-4b6a-8649-97b2caa7c64e?resizing_type=fit)
    
5.  Connect the output of the Panner to the **UVs** input on the Texture Sample. Pass the **RGB** output of the texture into the **Base Color** input on the Main Material Node.
    
    [![Connect nodes to Base Color](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/51bf7cc0-f968-4eee-90b7-02d57b636b7e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/51bf7cc0-f968-4eee-90b7-02d57b636b7e?resizing_type=fit)
    
6.  To make the texure pan, first select the **Panner** Material Expression and then in the **Details** panel, set the **Speed X** parameter to **0.1**.
    
    [![Set Speed X in Panner node](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1c11306a-935c-4683-9569-aecf6311b6ec?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1c11306a-935c-4683-9569-aecf6311b6ec?resizing_type=fit)
    
7.  As soon as you change **Speed X** to **0.1**, you should see the Fire Texture begin to move horizontally in the preview window.
    
8.  **Compile** and **Save** the Material so you can apply it to objects in your level.
    
    [![Compile and save](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b93a95f8-7631-40f2-8ad6-bc7ce6df5f20?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b93a95f8-7631-40f2-8ad6-bc7ce6df5f20?resizing_type=fit)
    

## Tips and Tricks

Using panning in combination with other Material Expressions is a great way to add extra control to how the panning works. In the example below, three Scalar Parameters were added to the Material to control texture **Tiling**, **Speed X**, and **Speed Y**. Because they are parameters, artists can override their values in Material Instances to customize the apearance of the Material.

[![Panning Material with parameters](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eca9c588-937c-4752-81d2-4e2fa06798cf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/eca9c588-937c-4752-81d2-4e2fa06798cf?resizing_type=fit)

You can also stack **Panner** Material Expressions to make the illusion of movement even more complex. Layering numerous texures and panning them at different speeds, or blending them through masks can produce sophisticated results, useful for smoke, water, and visual effects.

In this example, a copy of the all the original Material Expression nodes was created by first selecting all the Material Expression nodes and pressing **CTRL + D** on the keyboard. The scale, panning direction, and speed of the newly created nodes was changed to give an impression of layered motion. The new cluster of nodes was passed into **Emissive Color** instead of Base Color to give the Material more of a fiery appearance.

## Conclusion

Animating UV coordinates is a great way to introduce motion into your Materials. It is also extremely useful for visual effects that require complex motion like smoke or fire. However keep in mind that animating UV coordinates works best on objects that have contiguous UV setups. Any gaps or seams in a mesh's UV coordinates will show up when the UV coordinates are animated.
