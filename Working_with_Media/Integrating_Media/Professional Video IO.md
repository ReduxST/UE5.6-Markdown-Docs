Augmented reality experiences — mixing traditional 2D video with real-time 3D environments — are becoming increasingly in demand for film and broadcast media applications. The pages in this section describe how you can make the Unreal Engine work as a seamless part of your video production pipeline:

-   Play professional-level video and audio live in the Unreal Engine, composited into the virtual 3D world on the fly.
-   Apply effects to the imported video directly in the Unreal Engine, like chroma-keying, lens undistortion, color correction, and more.
-   Synchronize the Unreal Engine with the timecode and frame rate of your input video, to eliminate timing issues.
-   Render video feeds from the Unreal Editor or from your running game project back out to your studio's video pipeline.
