## What is SMPTE 2110?

Developed by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, SMPTE-2110 is a set of rules that define how digital content, such as video, audio, and other data, can be sent over IP (Internet Protocol) networks instead of by traditional cables. [Learn more about SMPTE ST 2110 standards on their website.](https://www.smpte.org/standards/st2110)

Unreal Engine now supports SMPTE-2110 using **NVIDIA Rivermax**, which provides a way for broadcast studios to integrate powerful tools offered by Unreal Engine into their current workflow, and ensures compatibility with other SMPTE-2110 equipment and software. To fully leverage this integration, there are hardware and licensing requirements.
