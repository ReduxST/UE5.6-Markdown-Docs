### Slider Sensitivity

Increase or decrease to adjust the sensitivity for property sliders globally across Unreal Stage

## Lock

Lock and unlock the app to prevent stray or accidental taps and changes by pressing and holding the Lock option. This allows you to walk around on-set without needing to put the app to sleep.
