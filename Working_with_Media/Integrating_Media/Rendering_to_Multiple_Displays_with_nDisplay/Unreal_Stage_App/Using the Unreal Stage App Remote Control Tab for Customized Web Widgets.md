## Remote Control Tab

For customized remote control requirements beyond Light Cards and Color Grading, you can also use the Remote Control Web Interface in conjunction with the app. Any Remote Control Presets and their web configuration are also accessible via the Remote Control Web Interface tab without the need to context switch back to the iPadâ€™s web browser. By default, this will use the same IP address that the app is connected to for web purposes.
