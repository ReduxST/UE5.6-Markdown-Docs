## Connection Screen

After launching Unreal Stage on the tablet, the app will ask you to connect to an Unreal Engine Editor instance based on an IP address. It will scan the network and if any Unreal Engine instances that have remote control enabled are discovered, they will automatically appear as selectable options in the list. The app will remember the last IP address you connected to and you may also manually enter an IP address if none are detected.

## Multiple nDisplay Root Actors in Scene

In scenes with multiple nDisplay Root Actors, Unreal Stage will prompt you to choose one to control. This setting is remembered from session to session on a per-scene basis when there are multiple nDisplay Root Actors and can be changed later on in Settings.
