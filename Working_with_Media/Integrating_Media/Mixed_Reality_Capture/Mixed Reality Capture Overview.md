The Mixed Reality Capture (MRC) framework makes it easy for users to composite real players into a virtual play space so that observing XR experiences is more compelling.

Mixed Reality Capture support has three components: video input, calibration, and in-game compositing. We have a list of supported [webcams and HDMI capture devices](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/supported-video-devices-for-mixed-reality-capture-in-unreal-engine) that enable you to pull real world green screened video into the Unreal Engine from a variety of sources. If you have a separate tracking device, Mixed Reality Capture can match your camera location to the in-game camera to make shots more dynamic and interesting. Setup and calibration is done through a standalone calibration tool. Once you set up and calibrate your filming location, you can reuse those calibration settings across Unreal applications.

While feature support is in Beta, we're looking forward to getting feedback as we continue to improve the framework.
