Epic Games no longer supports or maintains the Panoramic Capture Plugin, and it only exists as a reference if you want to create your own solution. The plugin may not work as-is.

In the following example, you will take a look at how you can set up, create, and view stereo panoramic screenshotsâ€”all from inside UE4. When you have completed this project, you will have created a panoramic image.

## 1 - Project Setup

In this section, we will create and then set up a new UE5 project.

### Steps

1.  Create a new Project from the **Games > First Person** template, with the following settings:

***Blueprint*** **Target Platform Desktop** ***Quality Preset Maximum*** **Starter Content** enabled

1.  Press the **Create** button to load the new project.
    
    This could be any project. The above values are listed simply to provide a starting point for creating a project.
    
2.  With your project open, select **Edit** > **Plugins** from the main menu.

3.  From the **Plugins** menu, under **Movie Capture**, enable the **Panoramic Capture** plugin. Restart the editor when prompted.
    
    Click image to expand.
    

## 2 - Taking Stereo Images

In this step, you will use the **Panoramic Capture** plugin and the **BP\_Capture** Blueprint to capture the images of the level in Stereo 3D.

### Steps

1.  Open the **Content Drawer**, and browse to **PanoramicCapture Content > Assets**. ![Assets Folder](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/8c4d13af-1cf8-4bce-a11c-64fb20e664a4/04-bp-capture_ue5.png "Assets Folder")

By default, the **Content Drawer** does not show plugin content. To change this, select **Settings**, then enable **Show Engine Content** and **Show Plugin Content**.

1.  Drag the **BP\_Capture** Blueprint onto the scene.
    
2.  Click **Play** to kick off the **BP\_Capture** and start the capture process.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
3.  During the capture process, the editor might appear to be frozen or unresponsive for a few seconds up to a few minutes. This is due to the demanding rendering requirements of the **Panoramic Capture** plugin. When the editor becomes responsive again, you will be able to find the screenshots in the following location.
    
    -   **C:\\PanoramicCaptureFrames\[Date & Time\]\\FinalColor\\Frame\_00000\_FinalColor.png**
        
        Click image to expand.
        
4.  Here is a view of the stereo image generated by **BP\_Capture**.
    
    Click image to expand.
    
    The default output of the **BP\_Capture** Blueprint is 8-bit (.png), with 32-bit (.exr) as an optional setting in the Blueprint.
