Sound is vital to creating believable and immersive environments. From ambient sounds to interactive sounds of vehicles or weapons, from music cues to spoken dialog, audio in a game can make or break the user experience.

The Audio Engine system in Unreal Engine provides tools and features that offer ways for audio designers and engineers to mold audio to match their visions. This means that a clean version of the sound can be produced once in an external application, imported, then crafted within the engine to create the desired result.
