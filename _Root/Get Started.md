## Getting started with Unreal Engine?

Unreal Engine is a powerful tool for creating 3D interactive experiences. There are many different ways to get started, depending on what your project and team needs. In this document, you’ll find all the core starting points for users coming to the engine - whether you're new, a licensee, coming from a different game engine or DCC package, or looking to see if UE is right for your project. 

### New to Unreal Engine

Are you new to Unreal Engine? Or, looking to see if UE could be a good fit for your project? Start with the [Unreal Engine for New Users](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-for-new-users) documentation where you'll learn how to create a first person adventure game from scratch. You'll set up your character in C++, create interactive elements in your level with Blueprints, import and customize your assets, and create linear content such as cinematics - all in engine!
