With Unreal Engine, you can integrate your pre-recorded media into your project seamlessly and share your rendered frames live or recorded. Use Unreal Engine's real-time rendering for shooting real-time visual effects, broadcasting on air or to tape, and rendering on complex arrangements of physical displays for live performances. With end-to-end color management and the ability to synchronize multiple media sources, Unreal can fit into the technical pipeline for any virtual production or live event.

The following sections contain information on the tools and workflows to make the most of media and rendered frames for your projects and audience.
