To help you understand the various ways you can use Unreal Engine (UE) and the assets you can create with it, Epic Games has assembled a collection of learning resources for you to download, play with, and deconstruct.

## Unreal Engine Templates

When you create a new Unreal Engine project, you have the option to use one of the existing UE templates as a base for your game or application. Unreal Engine templates contain character controllers, Blueprints, and other features that work without the need for additional configuration.

## Learning Resource Projects

Epic Games offers sample projects to highlight and teach various engine features and workflows. You can acquire the projects from [Fab.com](https://www.fab.com/) or the Fab plugin for Unreal Engine and then access the files from the **Epic Games Launcher** under **Unreal Engine > Library > Fab Library**.

Fab Library in the Epic Games Launcher.

Sample projects only appear in **Fab Library** when you have the compatible engine version installed.

The Fab plugin, or Fab integration, for Unreal Engine, is available for versions 5.3 and above. If you have 5.3 or 5.4 already installed, you must download the plugin from the **Fab Library** in the Epic Games Launcher separately to start using it. For new engine installs or updates, the Fab plugin is automatically included.

To access the plugins in Unreal Engine after the install is complete, do one of the following:

-   In the menu bar, click **Window > Fab**.
    
-   Open the **Content Drawer**, and in the toolbar, click **Fab**.
    

When you click either option, the plugin opens in a new window. You can find the latest sample projects under the **UE Samples** section of the **Discover** page. Use the search bar to find additional projects.
