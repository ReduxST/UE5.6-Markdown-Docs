Unreal Engine provides a robust framework for C++ programmers to help bring their vision to life.

This section assumes that you have some experience with C++.

This section covers several powerful features that you can use to accelerate your development workflows. You can learn about:

-   Creating new [Gameplay classes](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-classes-in-unreal-engine) in C++, and all changes will be reflected in the [Unreal Editor](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-editor-interface) after compiling with either [Visual Studio](/documentation/404) or XCode. Creating classes in Unreal Engine is similar to creating standard C++ classes, functions, and variables. These are defined using [standard C++ syntax](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine).
    
-   Using the [Unreal Reflection System](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/reflection-system-in-unreal-engine) to encapsulate your classes with [Metadata Property Specifier](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/metadata-specifiers-in-unreal-engine) macros that provide Editor functionality. Each class defines a template for a new Object or Actor.
    
-   [Containers in Unreal Engine](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/containers-in-unreal-engine) provide information on Class and Data Structure collections.
    
-   Using the [Gameplay Architecture](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/programming-with-cpp-in-unreal-engine) to build your projects in Unreal Engine. The Gameplay Framework provides a hierarchy of Objects and Actors. These classes contain boilerplate variables and functions you can use when creating and designing interactive experiences.
    
-   Creating [Delegates](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/delegates-and-lambda-functions-in-unreal-engine) to call member functions on C++ objects in a generic, type-safe way. You can dynamically bind a delegate to a member function of an arbitrary object, calling the function on the object at a future time, even if the caller does not know the object\`s type.
