Gameplay Systems contains information about high-level gameplay programming and scripting in **Unreal Engine**(**UE**), with a focus on facilitating interaction between the player and the world.

-   The [Gameplay Framework](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine) in UE includes Core Systems and frameworks for handling common gameplay elements such as [Actors](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/actors-in-unreal-engine), [Cameras](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cameras-in-unreal-engine), [Components](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/components-in-unreal-engine), [Controllers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/controllers-in-unreal-engine), [Game Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/game-features-and-modular-gameplay-in-unreal-engine), [Game Mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/game-mode-and-game-state-in-unreal-engine), [Player Input](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/input-in-unreal-engine), [Gameplay Timers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-timers-in-unreal-engine), and [User Interfaces](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/user-interfaces-and-huds-in-unreal-engine).
    
-   [Artificial Intelligence](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/artificial-intelligence-in-unreal-engine) describes the various systems available that can be used to create within UE such as [Behavior Trees](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/behavior-trees-in-unreal-engine), [Mass Entity System](making-interactive-experiences\artificial-intelligence\mass-entity), [State Trees](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/state-tree-in-unreal-engine), [Navigation System](making-interactive-experiences\artificial-intelligence\navigation), [Smart Objects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/smart-objects-in-unreal-engine), [Environment Query System](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/environment-query-system-in-unreal-engine), [AI Perception Component](making-interactive-experiences\artificial-intelligence\ai-perception) and [Debugging](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/ai-debugging-in-unreal-engine).
    
-   [Physics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/physics-in-unreal-engine) contains various subsystems that calculate [Collision](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/collision-in-unreal-engine), [Raycasts](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/traces-with-raycasts-in-unreal-engine), [Chaos Destruction](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/chaos-destruction-in-unreal-engine), and simulate [physical actors](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/physics-bodies-in-unreal-engine), [Cloth Physics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cloth-simulation-in-unreal-engine) and [materials](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/physical-materials-in-unreal-engine) including [Hair Physics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/hair-physics-in-unreal-engine).
    
-   [Large World Coordinates](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/large-world-coordinates-in-unreal-engine-5) introduces support for double-precision data variant types in UE where extensive changes are being implemented across all engine systems to improve floating-point precision.
    
-   [Data-Driven Gameplay Elements](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/data-driven-gameplay-elements-in-unreal-engine) helps mitigate the amount of work and complexity involved for games that have an extended lifetime. For example, some games may offer updates to users through an online service model. This model may adjust certain data parameters within that game to balance or add content based on user feedback.
    
-   [Gameplay Ability System](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-ability-system-for-unreal-engine) is a highly flexible framework for building the types of abilities and attributes that you might find in an RPG or MOBA title. You can build actions or passive abilities for the characters in your games to use, and status effects that can build up or wear down various attributes as a result of these actions, additionally you can implement "cooldown" timers or resource costs to regulate the usage of these actions, change the level of the ability and its effects at each level, activate particle, sound effects, and more.
    
-   [Vehicles](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/vehicles-in-unreal-engine) is Unreal Engine's lightweight system for performing vehicle physics simulations.
    
-   [Networking and Multiplayer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/networking-and-multiplayer-in-unreal-engine) Modern multiplayer experiences require synchronizing vast amounts of data between large numbers of clients spread around the world. What data you send and how you send it is extremely important to providing a compelling experience to users since it can drastically affect how your project performs and feels
    
-   The [Gameplay Tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-tutorials-for-unreal-engine) guides in this section will provide a reference for how to use these features, as well as walkthroughs for how to re-create common mechanics and systems in games both in Blueprint and C++.
