Motion Design is a feature set for motion graphics artists who need a streamlined and creative suite of tools that provide for rapid iteration and scalability. Motion Design includes a reworked world outliner, user interface, rigging tools, cloners, customizable 2D/3D shapes, and a new way to create materials using a streamlined, layer-based workflow called Material Designer.

Everything you create can be rigged with customizable logic that you can version using a variety of approachable solutions. Motion Design offers a robust Rundown tool that, in conjunction with its Transition Logic system, can run live-updated broadcast graphics with minimal rigging.

All of Motion Design's features combine to help you create on-air compatible graphics as well as high-end 3D product design and advertising visuals.
