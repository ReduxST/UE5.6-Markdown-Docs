The **Niagara VFX System** is the primary tool to do visual effects (VFX) inside Unreal Engine 5 (UE5).

This page links to documentation regarding the Niagara VFX system, including an Overview and a Quick Start guide to get you up and running. If you are new to Niagara, it is recommended that you check out the **Getting Started** section which includes a high-level overview of the Niagara Editor, the Quick Start Guide, and a page that lays out the Key Concepts and design philosophy behind Niagara.

You can also check out the **Tutorials** section, which has step-by-step project guides.

The **Reference** section has the System and Emitter Module Reference, the Niagara Editor UI Reference, and the Niagara Script Editor UI Reference.

## Getting Started and Tutorials

The Getting Started page will help you learn Niagara for the first time. Here you will find pages such as an overview of Niagara, key concepts that describe the architecture, and quickstart tutorials to start your very first projects.

To go a step further, check out more tutorials that will walk you step-by-step in creating a few projects. By practicing with some different effects, you can quickly get the hang of how to build Niagara systems.

## Niagara Features

Explore these Niagara features in more depth to learn about the capabilities of the system. Learn about Fluids, or the experimental GPU Raytracing Collisions module.

For advanced users, the modules that are supplied with Niagara to start with may not be sufficient to achieve the full effect you are looking for. You can use the Niagara Script Editor to adjust existing modules or create your own.

## Debugging and Optimization in Niagara

As you start to play around with the tools, you may want to start to refine your Niagara simulations. The Debug Drawing tool helps to visualize some components of supported modules. The Niagara Debugger runs real-time analyses of performance on simulations in your level.

## Reference

Finally, for any detailed questions you may have about the user interface, specific buttons, or modules, check out the Reference pages.
