(default) |
| `r.SceneRenderTargetResizeMethod` | `0` | Control the scene render target resize method: (This value is only used in game mode and on windowing platforms unless 'r.SceneRenderTargetsResizingMethodForceOverride' is enabled.) 0: Resize to match requested render size (Default) (Least memory use, can cause stalls when size changes e.g. ScreenPercentage) 1: Fixed to screen resolution. 2: Expands to encompass the largest requested render dimension. (Most memory use, least prone to allocation stalls.) |
| `r.SceneRenderTargetResizeMethodForceOverride` | `0` | Forces 'r.SceneRenderTargetResizeMethod' to be respected on all configurations. 0: Disabled. 1: Enabled. |

| `r.Shadow.PerObject` | `1` | Whether to render per object shadows (character casting on world) 0: off 1: on (default) |
| `r.Shadow.PerObjectCastDistanceMin` | `32768` | Minimum cast distance for Per-Object shadows, i.e., CastDistDance = Max(r.Shadow.PerObjectCastDistanceRadiusScale x object-radius, r.Shadow.PerObjectCastDistanceMin). Default: UE\_FLOAT\_HUGE\_DISTANCE / 32.0f |
| `r.Shadow.PerObjectCastDistanceRadiusScale` | `8` | PerObjectCastDistanceRadiusScale The scale factor multiplied with the radius of the object to calculate the maximum distance a per-object directional shadow can reach. This will only take effect after a certain (large) radius. Default is 8 times the object radius. |

| `r.Shadow.Scene.DebugDrawLightActiveStateTracking` | `0` | . |
| `r.Shadow.Scene.LightActiveFrameCount` | `10` | Number of frames before a light that has been moving (updated or transform changed) goes to inactive state. This determines the number of frames that the MobilityFactor goes to zero over, and thus a higher number spreads invalidations out over a longer time. |
| `r.shadow.ShadowMapsRenderEarly` | `0` | If enabled, shadows will render earlier in the frame. This can help async compute scheduling on some platforms Note: This is not compatible with VSMs |
| `r.Shadow.ShadowMaxSlopeScaleDepthBias` | `1` | Max Slope depth bias used for shadows for all lights Higher values give better self-shadowing, but increase self-shadowing artifacts |

| `r.Shadow.TexelsPerPixelSpotlight` | `2.54648` | The ratio of subject pixels to shadow texels for spotlights |
| `r.Shadow.TransitionScale` | `60` | This controls the 'fade in' region between a caster and where its shadow shows up. Larger values make a smaller region which will have more self shadowing artifacts |
| `r.Shadow.TranslucentPerObject.ProjectEnabled` | `0` | Enable/Disable translucency shadows on a per-project basis. Turning off can significantly reduce the number of permutations if your project has many translucent materials. |

| `r.Shadow.UseOctreeForCulling` | `1` | Whether to use the primitive octree for shadow subject culling. The octree culls large groups of primitives at a time, but introduces cache misses walking the data structure. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.AccumulateStats` | `0` | When enabled, VSM stats will be collected over multiple frames and written to a CSV file |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.AllocatePagePoolAsReservedResource` | `1` | Allocate VSM page pool as a reserved/virtual texture, backed by N small physical memory allocations to reduce fragmentation. |

| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.ClipmapPanning` | `1` | Enable support for panning cached clipmap pages for directional lights, allowing re-use of cached data when the camera moves. Keep this enabled outside of debugging. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.DebugSkipDynamicPageInvalidation` | `0` | Skip invalidation of cached pages when geometry moves for debugging purposes. This will create obvious visual artifacts when disabled. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.DeformableMeshesInvalidate` | `1` | If enabled, Primitive Proxies that are marked as having deformable meshes (HasDeformableMesh() == true) cause invalidations regardless of whether their transforms are updated. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.DrawInvalidatingBounds` | `0` | Turn on debug render cache invalidating instance bounds, heat mapped by number of pages invalidated. 1 = Draw all bounds. 2 = Draw those invalidating static cached pages only 3 = Draw those invalidating dynamic cached pages only |

| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.InvalidateUseHZB` | `1` | When enabled, instances invalidations are tested against the HZB. Instances that are fully occluded will not cause page invalidations. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.MaxPageAgeSinceLastRequest` | `3` | The maximum number of frames to allow cached pages that aren't requested in the current frame to live. 0=disabled. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.StaticSeparate` | `1` | When enabled, caches static objects in separate pages from dynamic objects. This can improve performance in largely static scenes, but doubles the memory cost of the physical page pool. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Cache.StaticSeparate.FramesStaticThreshold` | `100` | Number of frames without an invalidation before an object will transition to static caching. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.FirstCoarseLevel` | `15` | First level of the clipmap to mark coarse pages for. Lower values allow higher resolution coarse pages near the camera but increase total page counts. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.FirstLevel` | `6` | First level of the virtual clipmap. Lower values allow higher resolution shadows closer to the camera, but may increase page count. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.GreedyLevelSelection` | `0` | When enabled, allows greedily sampling more detailed clipmap levels if they happen to be mapped. This can increase shadow quality from certain viewing angles, but makes the clipmap boundry less stable which can exacerbate visual artifacts at low shadow resolutions. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.LastCoarseLevel` | `18` | Last level of the clipmap to mark coarse pages for. Higher values provide dense clipmap data for a longer radius but increase total page counts. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.LastLevel` | `22` | Last level of the virtual clipmap. Indirectly determines radius the clipmap can cover. Each extra level doubles the maximum range, but may increase page count. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.MinCameraViewportWidth` | `0` | If greater than zero, clamps the camera viewport dimensions used to adjust the clipmap resolution. This can be useful to avoid dynamic resolution indirectly dropping the shadow resolution far too low. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.UseConservativeCulling` | `0` | Conservative culling removes the frustum-clipped culling volume for the non-nanite geometry for VSM rendering. This means a lot more geometry is submitted, and also marked as rendered. Useful to diagnose if there are culling artifacts in virtual shadow map clip maps due to errors in the tracking code. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.WPODisableDistance` | `1` | When enabled, disables WPO animation in clipmap levels based on a primitive's WPO disable distance and r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.WPODisableDistance.LodBias setting. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.WPODisableDistance.LodBias` | `3` | The number of clipmap levels further than the distance that an instance would be animated to allow shadow animation. Typically 2-4 works well but may need to be adjusted for very low light angles with significant WPO movement. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.ZRangeScale` | `1000` | Scale of the clipmap level depth range relative to the radius. Affects z-near/z-far of the shadow map. Should generally be at least 10 or it will result in excessive cache invalidations. Values that are too large cause depth imprecisions and shadow flickering. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.CoarsePagePixelThresholdDynamic` | `16` | If a dynamic (non-nanite) instance has a smaller estimated pixel footprint than this value, it should not be drawn into a coarse page. Higher values cull away more instances. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.CoarsePagePixelThresholdDynamicNanite` | `4` | If a dynamic Nanite instance has a smaller estimated pixel footprint than this value, it should not be drawn into a coarse page. Higher values cull away more instances. This value is typically lower than the non-Nanite one because Nanite has lower overhead for drawing small objects. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.CoarsePagePixelThresholdStatic` | `1` | If a static (non-nanite) instance has a smaller estimated pixel footprint than this value, it should not be drawn into a coarse page. Higher values cull away more instances. This value is typically lower than the non-static one because the static pages have better caching. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.CullBackfacingPixels` | `1` | When enabled does not generate shadow data for pixels that are backfacing to the light. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.DebugSkipMergePhysical` | `0` | Skip the merging of the static VSM cache into the dynamic one. This will create obvious visual artifacts when disabled. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.DistantLightForceCacheFootprintFraction` | `0` | Fraction of footprint size below which start force-caching lights that are invalidated (i.e., are moving or re-added) Larger values may improve performance but may also produce more visible artifacts The base footprint is based on the page size. 0.0 == Never force-cache (default), 1.0 == Always force-cache. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.DistantLightMode` | `1` | Control whether distant light mode is enabled for local lights. 0 == Off, 1 == On (default), 2 == Force All. When on, lights with a pixel footprint below the threshold are marked as distant. Updates to distant lights are throttled (force-cached), they use simpler page-table logic and the memory cost is lower. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.DynamicRes.MaxPagePoolLoadFactor` | `0.85` | If allocation exceeds this factor of total page pool capacity, shadow resolution will be biased downwards. 0 = disabled |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.DynamicRes.MaxResolutionLodBias` | `2` | As page allocation approaches the pool capacity, VSM resolution ramps down by biasing the LOD up, similar to 'ResolutionLodBiasDirectional'. This is the maximum LOD bias to clamp to for global dynamic shadow resolution reduction. 0 = disabled |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Enable` | `1` | Enable Virtual Shadow Maps. Renders geometry into virtualized shadow depth maps for shadowing. Provides high - quality shadows for next - gen projects with simplified setup.High efficiency culling when used with Nanite. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ForceFullHZBUpdate` | `0` | Forces full HZB update every frame rather than just dirty pages. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ForceOnlyVirtualShadowMaps` | `1` | If enabled, disallow creation of conventional non-virtual shadow maps for any lights that get a virtual shadow map. This can improve performance and save memory, but any geometric primitives that cannot be rendered into the virtual shadow map will not cast shadows. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ForcePerLightShadowMaskClear` | `0` | For debugging purposes. When enabled, the shadow mask texture is cleared before the projection pass writes to it. Projection pass writes all relevant pixels, so clearing should be unnecessary. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkCoarsePagesDirectional` | `1` | Marks coarse pages in directional light virtual shadow maps so that low resolution data is available everywhere.Ability to disable is primarily for profiling and debugging. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkCoarsePagesLocal` | `1` | Marks coarse pages in local light virtual shadow maps so that low resolution data is available everywhere.Ability to disable is primarily for profiling and debugging. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkPixelPages` | `1` | Marks pages in virtual shadow maps based on depth buffer pixels. Ability to disable is primarily for profiling and debugging. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.MarkPixelPagesMipModeLocal` | `0` | When enabled, this uses a subset of mips to reduce instance duplication in VSMs. Will result in better performance but a harsher falloff on mip transitions. 0 - Disabled: Use all 8 mips 1 - Quality Mode: Use 4 higher res mips (16k, 4k, 1k, 256) 2 - Performance Mode: Use 4 lower res mips (8k, 2k, 512, 128) |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.MaxDistantUpdatePerFrame` | `1` | Maximum number of distant lights to update each frame. Invalidated lights that were missed may be updated in a later frame (round-robin). |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.MaxPhysicalPages` | `4096` | Maximum number of physical pages in the pool. More space for pages means more memory usage, but allows for higher resolution shadows. Ideally this value is large enough to fit enough pages for all the lights in the scene, but not too large to waste memory. Enable 'ShowStats' to see how many pages are allocated in the pool right now. For more page pool control, see the 'ResolutionLodBias*', 'DynamicRes.*' and 'Cache.StaticSeparate' cvars. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.Nanite.MaterialVisibility` | `0` | Enable Nanite CPU-side visibility filtering of draw commands, depends on r.Nanite.MaterialVisibility being enabled. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.Batch` | `1` | . |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.CulledInstanceAllocationFactor` | `1` | Allocation size scale factor for the buffer used to store instances after culling. The total size accounts for the worst-case scenario in which all instances are emitted into every clip or mip level. This is far more than we'd expect in reasonable circumstances, so this scale factor is used to reduce memory pressure. The actual number cannot be known on the CPU as the culling emits an instance for each clip/mip level that is overlapped. Setting to 1.0 is fully conservative. Lowering this is likely to produce artifacts unless you're certain the buffer won't overflow. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.IncludeInCoarsePages` | `1` | Include non-Nanite geometry in coarse pages.Rendering non-Nanite geometry into large coarse pages can be expensive; disabling this can be a significant performance win. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.LargeInstancePageAreaThreshold` | `-1` | How large area is considered a 'large' footprint, summed over all overlapped levels, if set to -1 uses the physical page pool size / 8. Used as a threshold when storing page area coverage stats for diagnostics. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.MaxCulledInstanceAllocationSize` | `134217728` | Maximum number of instances that may be output from the culling pass into all VSM mip/clip levels. At 12 byte per instance reference this represents a 1.5GB clamp. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.NumPageAreaDiagSlots` | `0` | Number of slots in diagnostics to report non-nanite instances with the largest page area coverage, < 0 uses the max number allowed, 0 disables. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.SinglePassBatched` | `1` | . |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNanite.UseHZB` | `2` | Cull Non-Nanite instances using HZB. Set to 0 to disable. Set to 1 to use HZB from previous frame. Can incorrectly cull in some cases due to outdated data. Set to 2 to use two-pass Nanite culling with HZB from the current frame. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NonNaniteVSM` | `1` | Enable support for non-nanite Virtual Shadow Maps.Read-only and to be set in a config file (requires restart). |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.NormalBias` | `0.5` | Receiver offset along surface normal for shadow lookup. Scaled by distance to camera.Higher values avoid artifacts on surfaces nearly parallel to the light, but also visibility offset shadows and increase the chance of hitting unmapped pages. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.OnePassProjection` | `1` | Projects all local light virtual shadow maps in a single pass for better performance. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.OnePassProjection.MaxLightsPerPixel` | `16` | Maximum lights per pixel that get full filtering when using one pass projection and clustered shading.Generally set to 8 (32bpp), 16 (64bpp) or 32 (128bpp). Lower values require less transient VRAM during the lighting pass. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.OnePassProjection.SkipScreenShadowMask` | `1` | Allows skipping the screen space shadow mask entirely when only a virtual shadow map would write into it. Should generally be left enabled outside of debugging. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.PageDilationBorderSizeDirectional` | `0.05` | If a screen pixel falls within this fraction of a page border for directional lights, the adacent page will also be mapped.Higher values can reduce page misses at screen edges or disocclusions, but increase total page counts. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.PageDilationBorderSizeLocal` | `0.05` | If a screen pixel falls within this fraction of a page border for local lights, the adacent page will also be mapped.Higher values can reduce page misses at screen edges or disocclusions, but increase total page counts. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.PageMarkingPixelStrideX` | `2` | During page marking, instead of testing every screen pixel, test every Nth pixel. Page marking from screen pixels is used to determine which VSM pages are seen from the camera and need to be rendered. Increasing this value reduces page-marking costs, but could introduce artifacts due to missing pages. With sufficiently low values, it is likely a neighbouring pixel will mark the required page anyway. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.PageMarkingPixelStrideY` | `2` | Same as PageMarkingPixelStrideX, but on the vertical axis of the screen. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasDirectional` | `-1.5` | Bias applied to LOD calculations for directional lights. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasDirectionalMoving` | `-1.5` | Bias applied to LOD calculations for directional lights that are moving. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on. The bias transitions smoothly back to ResolutionLodBiasDirectional as the light transitions to non-moving, see 'r.Shadow.Scene.LightActiveFrameCount'. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasLocal` | `0` | Bias applied to LOD calculations for local lights. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ResolutionLodBiasLocalMoving` | `1` | Bias applied to LOD calculations for local lights that are moving. -1.0 doubles resolution, 1.0 halves it and so on. The bias transitions smoothly back to ResolutionLodBiasLocal as the light transitions to non-moving, see 'r.Shadow.Scene.LightActiveFrameCount'. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ScreenRayLength` | `0.015` | Length of the screen space shadow trace away from receiver surface (smart shadow bias) before the VSM / SMRT lookup. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ShowClipmapStats` | `-1` | Set to the number of clipmap you want to show stats for (-1 == off) |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ShowLightDrawEvents` | `0` | Enable Virtual Shadow Maps per-light draw events - may affect performance especially when there are many small lights in the scene. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.ShowStats` | `0` | Show VSM statistics. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.AdaptiveRayCount` | `1` | Shoot fewer rays in fully shadowed and unshadowed regions. Currently only supported with OnePassProjection. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.ExtrapolateMaxSlopeDirectional` | `5` | Maximum depth slope when extrapolating behind occluders for directional lights. Higher values allow softer penumbra edges but can introduce light leaks behind second occluders. Setting to 0 will disable slope extrapolation slightly improving projection performance, at the cost of reduced penumbra quality. |
| `r.Shadow.Virtual.SMRT.ExtrapolateMaxSlopeLocal` | `0.05` | Maximum depth slope when extrapolating behind occluders for local lights.

| `r.TSR.ForceSeparateTranslucency` | `1` | Overrides r.SeparateTranslucency whenever TSR is enabled (enabled by default). |
| `r.TSR.History.R11G11B10` | `1` | Select the bitdepth of the history. r.TSR.History.R11G11B10=1 Saves memory bandwidth that is of particular interest of the TSR's UpdateHistory's runtime performance by saving memory both at previous frame's history reprojection and write out of the output and new history. This optimisation is unsupported with r.PostProcessing.PropagateAlpha=1. Please also not that increasing r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage=200 adds 2 additional implicit encoding bits in the history compared to the TSR.Output's bitdepth thanks to the downscaling pass from TSR history resolution to TSR output resolution. |
| `r.TSR.History.SampleCount` | `16` | Maximum number sample for each output pixel in the history. Higher values means more stability on highlights on static images, but may introduce additional ghosting on firefliers style of VFX. Minimum value supported is 8.0 as TSR was in 5.0 and 5.1. Maximum value possible due to the encoding of the TSR.History.Metadata is 32.0. Defaults to 16.0. Use r.TSR.Visualize 0" command to see how many samples where accumulated in TSR history on areas of the screen." |
| `r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage` | `200` | Resolution multiplier of the history of TSR based of output resolution. While increasing the resolution adds runtime cost to TSR, it allows to maintain a better sharpness and stability of the details stored in history through out the reprojection. Setting to 200 brings on a very particular property relying on NyQuist-Shannon sampling theorem that establishes a sufficient condition for the sample rate of the accumulated details in the history. As a result only values between 100 and 200 are supported. It is controlled by default in the anti-aliasing scalability group set to 200 on Epic and Cinematic, 100 otherwise. |
| `r.TSR.History.UpdateQuality` | `3` | Selects shader permutation of the quality of the update of the history in the TSR HistoryUpdate pass currently driven by the sg.AntiAliasingQuality scalability group. For further details about what each offers, you are invited to look at DIM\_UPDATE\_QUALITY in TSRUpdateHistory.usf and customise to your need. |
| `r.TSR.RejectionAntiAliasingQuality` | `2` | Controls the quality of TSR's built-in spatial anti-aliasing technology when the history needs to be rejected. While this may not be critical when the rendering resolution is not much lowered than display resolution, this technic however becomes essential to hide lower rendering resolution rendering because of two reasons: - the screen space size of aliasing is inverse proportional to rendering resolution; - rendering at lower resolution means need more frame to reach at least 1 rendered pixel per display pixel. Use r.TSR.Visualize 6" command to see on screen where the spatial anti-aliaser quicks in green. By default, it is only disabled by default in the low anti-aliasing scalability group." |
| `r.TSR.Resurrection` | `1` | Allows TSR to resurrect previously discarded details from many frames ago. When enabled, the entire frames of the TSR are stored in a same unique Texture2DArray including a configurable number of persistent frame (defined by r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameCount) that are occasionally recorded (defined by r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameInterval). Then every frame, TSR will attempt to reproject either previous frame, or the oldest persistent frame available based which matches best the current frames. The later option will happen when something previously seen by TSR shows up again (no matter through parallax disocclusion, shading changes, translucent VFX moving) which will have the advantage bypass the need to newly accumulate a second time by simply resurrected the previously accumulated details. Command r.TSR.Visualize 4" too see parts of the screen is being resurrected by TSR in green. Command "r.TSR.Visualize 5" too see the oldest frame being possibly resurrected. Currently experimental and disabled by default." |
| `r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameCount` | `2` | Configures the number of persistent frame to record in history for futur history resurrection. This will increase the memory footprint of the entire TSR history. Must be an even number greater or equal to 2. (default=2) |
| `r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameInterval` | `31` | Configures in number of frames how often persistent frame should be recorded in history for futur history resurrection. This has no implication on memory footprint of the TSR history. Must be an odd number greater or equal to 1. Uses the VisualizeTSR show flag and r.TSR.Visualize=5 to tune this parameter to your content. (default=31) |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.ExposureOffset` | `3` | The shading rejection needs to have a representative idea how bright a linear color pixel ends up displayed to the user. And the shading rejection detect if a color become to changed to be visible in the back buffer by comparing to MeasureBackbufferLDRQuantizationError(). It is important to have TSR's MeasureBackbufferLDRQuantizationError() ends up distributed uniformly across the range of color intensity or it could otherwise disregard some subtle VFX causing ghostin. This controls adjusts the exposure of the linear color space solely in the TSR's rejection heuristic, such that higher value lifts the shadows's LDR intensity, meaning MeasureBackbufferLDRQuantizationError() is decreased in these shadows and increased in the highlights, control directly. The best TSR internal buffer to verify this is TSR.Flickering.Luminance, either with the show VisualizeTemporalUpscaler" command or in DumpGPU with the RGB Linear\[0;1\] source color space against the Tonemaper's output in sRGB source color space." |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering` | `1` | Instability in TSR output 99% of the time coming from instability of the shading rejection, for different reasons: - One first source of instability is most famously moire pattern between structured geometry and the rendering pixel grid changing every frame due to the offset of the jittering pixel grid offset; - Another source of instability can happen on extrem geometric complexity due to temporal history's chicken-and-egg problem that can not be overcome by other mechanisms in place in TSR's RejectHistory pass: how can the history be identical to rendered frame if the amount of details you have in the rendered frame is not in history? how can the history accumulate details if the history is too different from the rendered frame? When enabled, this flickering temporal analysis monitor how the luminance of the scene right before any translucency drawing stored in the `TSR.Flickering.Luminance` resource how it involves over successive frames. And if it is detected to constantly flicker regularily above a certain threshold defined with this `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.*` cvars, the heuristic attempts to stabilize the image by letting ghost within luminance boundary tied to the amplititude of flickering. Use r.TSR.Visualize 7 command to see on screen where this heuristic quicks in orange and red. Pink is where it is disabled. One particular caveat of this heuristic is that any opaque geometry with incorrect motion vector can make a pixel look identically flickery quicking this heuristic in and leaving undesired ghosting effects on the said geometry. When that happens, it is highly encourage to verify the motion vector through the VisualizeMotionBlur show flag and how these motion vectors are able to reproject previous frame with the VisualizeReprojection show flag. The variable to countrol the frame frequency at which a pixel is considered flickery and needs to be stabilized with this heuristic is defined with the `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period` in frames. For instance, a value `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period=3`, it means any pixel that have its luminance changing of variation every more often than every frames is considered flickering. However another caveats on this boundary between flickering pixel versus animated pixel is that: flickering happens regardless of frame rate whereas a visual effects that are or should be based on time and are therefore independent of the frame rate. This mean that a visual effect that looks smooth at 60hz might appear to 'flicker' at lower frame rates, like 24hz for instance. To make sure a visual effect authored by an artists doesn't start to ghost of frame rate, `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.AdjustToFrameRate` is enabled by default such that this frame frequency boundary is automatically when the frame rate drops below a refresh rate below `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap`. While `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering` is controled based of scalability settings turn on/off this heuristic on lower or high-end GPU the other `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.*` can be set orthogonally in the Project's `DefaultEngine.ini` for a consistent behavior across all platforms.It is enabled by default in the anti-aliasing scalability group High, Epic, and Cinematic. |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.AdjustToFrameRate` | `1` | Whether r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period settings should adjust to frame rate when below r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap. Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Enabled by default). |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap` | `60` | Framerate cap in hertz at which point there is automatic adjustment of r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period when the rendering frame rate is lower. Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Default to 60hz) |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.MaxParallaxVelocity` | `10` | Some material might for instance might do something like parallax occlusion mapping such as CitySample's buildings' window's interiors. This often can not render accurately a motion vector of this fake interior geometry and therefore make the heuristic believe it is in fact flickering. This variable define the parallax velocity in 1080p pixel at frame rate defined by r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.FrameRateCap at which point the heuristic should be disabled to not ghost. (Default to 10 pixels 1080p). |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering.Period` | `2` | Periode in frames in which luma oscilations at equal or greater frequency is considered flickering and should ghost to stabilize the image Please read r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering's help for further details. (Default to 3 frames). |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.SampleCount` | `2` | Maximum number of sample in each output pixel of the history after total shading rejection. Lower values means higher clarity of the image after shading rejection of the history, but at the trade of higher instability of the pixel on following frames accumulating new details which can be distracting to the human eye (Defaults to 2.0). |
| `r.TSR.ShadingRejection.TileOverscan` | `3` | The shading rejection run a network of convolutions on the GPU all in single 32x32 without roundtrip to main video memory. However chaining many convlutions in this tiles means that some convolutions on the edge arround are becoming corrupted and therefor need to overlap the tile by couple of padding to hide it. Higher means less prones to tiling artifacts, but performance loss. |
| `r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingPixelSpeed` | `1` | Defines the output pixel velocity at which the the high frequencies of the history get's their contributing weight clamped. It's basically to lerp the effect of r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingSampleCount when the pixel velocity get smaller than r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingPixelSpeed. (Default = 1.0f). |
| `r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingSampleCount` | `4` | Number of sample to count to in history pixel to clamp history to when output pixel velocity reach `r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingPixelSpeed`. Higher value means higher stability on movement, but at the expense of additional blur due to successive convolution of each history reprojection. Use `r.TSR.Visualize 0` command to see how many samples where accumulated in TSR history on areas of the screen. Please note this clamp the sample count in history pixel, not output pixel, and therefore lower values are by designed less noticeable with higher `r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage`. This is done so such that increasing `r.TSR.History.ScreenPercentage` uniterally and automatically give more temporal stability and maintaining sharpness of the details reprojection at the expense of that extra runtime cost regardless of this setting. A story telling game might prefer to keep this 4.0 for a 'cinematic look' whereas a competitive game like Fortnite would preferer to lower that to 2.0. (Default = 4.0f)." |
| `r.TSR.Visualize` | `-1` | Selects the TSR internal visualization mode. -2: Display an overview grid based regardless of VisualizeTSR show flag; -1: Display an overview grid based on the VisualizeTSR show flag (default, opened with the `show VisualizeTSR` command at runtime or Show > Visualize > TSR in editor viewports); 0: Number of accumulated samples in the history, particularily interesting to tune r.TSR.ShadingRejection.SampleCount and r.TSR.Velocity.WeightClampingSampleCount; 1: Parallax disocclusion based of depth and velocity buffers; 2: Mask where the history is rejected; 3: Mask where the history is clamped; 4: Mask where the history is resurrected (with r.TSR.Resurrection=1); 5: Mask where the history is resurrected in the resurrected frame (with r.TSR.Resurrection=1), particularily interesting to tune r.TSR.Resurrection.PersistentFrameInterval; 6: Mask where spatial anti-aliasing is being computed; 7: Mask where the flickering temporal analysis heuristic is taking effects (with r.TSR.ShadingRejection.Flickering=1); |
| `r.TSR.WaveOps` | `1` | Whether to use wave ops in the shading rejection heuristics to speeds up convolutions. The shading rejection heuristic optimisation can be particularily hard for shader compiler and hit bug in them causing corruption/quality loss. Note this optimisation is currently disabled on SPIRV platforms (mainly Vulkan and Metal) due to 5min+ compilation times in SPIRV backend of DXC which is not great for editor startup. |
| `r.TSR.WaveSize` | `0` | Overrides the WaveSize to use. 0: Automatic (default); 16: WaveSizeOps 16; 32: WaveSizeOps 32; 64: WaveSizeOps 64; |
