## Source Control

| **Section** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Enable Validation Tag** | Adds validation a tag to the changelist description on submit. |
| **Should Delete New Files on Revert** | 
If enabled, source control deletes the files that have been marked for add from your computer when the changelist is reverted.

If disabled, the files are removed from source control when the changelist is reverted, but they stay on your local drive. This also removes the Add command.



 |
| **Collection Changelist Tags** | List of lines to add to any collection on check-in. |
| **Specific Collection Changelist Tags** | Map of collection names and additional text to apply to changelist descriptions when checking them in. |
