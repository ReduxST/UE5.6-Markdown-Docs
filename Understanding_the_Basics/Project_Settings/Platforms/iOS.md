## iOS

### Mobile Provision

By default, Unreal Engine scans all available mobile Provisioning Profiles and Certificates (supplied by Apple) on your computer and automatically chooses which ones to use.

You can override that behavior by selecting the Provisioning Profiles and Certificates in the following settings.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Import Provision** | Select the Provisioning Profiles for your application here. |
| **Import Certificate** | Select the Certificate for your application here. |

### Bundle Information

Note to users from 4.6 or earlier: The engine now generates an `Info.plist` file when building, so if you have customized your `.plist` file, you will need to transfer all of your changes into the settings below. Note that the engine doesn't change the `.plist` file that is in your project directory, so you can use it as a reference.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Bundle Display Name** | 
Specifies the display name for the application.

This displays under the icon on the device.



 |
| **Bundle Name** | 

Specifies the name of the application bundle.

This is the short name for the application bundle.



 |
| **Bundle Identifier** | Set a Bundle Identifier (Bundle ID) for unique identification of your app in the App Store. |
| **Version Info** | Specifies the version for the application. |

### Orientation

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Supports Portrait Orientation** | 
Support default portrait orientation.

Landscape will not be supported.



 |
| **Supports Upside Down Orientation** | 

Support upside-down orientation.

Landscape will not be supported.



 |
| **Supports Landscape Left Orientation** | 

Supports left landscape orientation.

If you select this, portrait orientation will not be supported.



 |
| **Supports Landscape Right Orientation** | 

Supports right landscape orientation.

If you select this, portrait orientation will not be supported.



 |
| **Preferred Landscape Orientation** | 

The Preferred Orientation will be used as the initial orientation at launch when both Landscape Left and Landscape Right orientations are supported.

You can choose from the following options:

-   **Landscape (left Home button)**
-   **Landscape (right Home button)**



 |

### Input

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Can the Game Have Multiple Gamepads Connected at a Single Time** | If enabled, the game will be able to handle multiple gamepads at the same time (the Siri Remote is a gamepad). |
| **Allow AppleTV Remote Landscape Mode** | If enabled, the Siri Remote can be rotated to landscape view. |
| **Use AppleTV Remote Absolute Trackpad Values** | 
If enabled, the center of the trackpad is `0,0` (center) for the virtual joystick.

If disabled, the location the user taps becomes `0,0`.



 |
| **Allow MFi (Bluetooth) Controllers** | If enabled, Bluetooth connected controllers will send input. |
| **Block Force Feedback on the Device When Controllers Are Attached** | Block force feedback on the device when controllers are attached. |
| **Disable Motion Controls** | 

Disables usage of device motion data.

If the application doesn't use motion data, disabling this option will improve battery life.



 |
| **Use Integrated Keyboard** | Defines whether or not the keyboard should be usable on its own without a `UITextField`. |

### File System

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Support iTunes File Sharing** | Defines whether files created by the app will be accessible from the iTunes File Sharing feature. |
| **Support Files App** | Defines whether files created by the app will be accessible from within the device's Files app (requires iTunes File Sharing). |

### Rendering

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Use Fast-Math Intrinsics** | 
Whether to use the Metal shading language's "fast" intrinsics.

Fast intrinsics assume that no `NaN` or `INF` value will be provided as input, so they are more efficient.

However, they will produce undefined results if `NaN` / `INF` is present in the arguments.



 |
| **Force 32-bit Floating Point Precision** | 

Defines whether to force Metal shaders to use 32-bit floating point precision even when the shader uses half-floats.

Half-floats are much more efficient (when they are available), but have less accuracy over large ranges. Some projects may need to use 32-bit floats to ensure correct rendering.



 |
| **Enable Fast-Math Optimizations** | 

Defines whether to use Metal shader-compiler's `-ffast-math` optimizations.

Fast-Math performs algebraic-equivalent and reassociative optimizations not permitted by the floating point arithmetic standard (IEEE-754).

These can improve shader performance at some cost to precision and can lead to NaN/INF propagation as they rely on shader inputs or variables not containing `NaN` / `INF` values.

By default, Fast-Math is enabled for performance.



 |
| **Tier of Indirect Argument Buffers to Use When Compiling Shaders** | Defines whether to compile shaders using a tier Indirect Argument Buffers. |
| **Support Apple A8** | Enables the support of Apple A8 devices and disables 3D texture compression. |
| **Metal Mobile Renderer** | Whether to compile iOS Metal shaders for the Mobile renderer (requires iOS 8+ and an A7 processor). |
| **Metal Desktop Renderer** | Whether to compile iOS Metal shaders for the desktop renderer (requires iOS 10+ and an A10 processor). |
| **Metal Shader Standard To Target** | 

The Metal shader language version to use when compiling the shaders.

You can choose from the following options:

-   **Minimum, Currently v2.3 (iOS 14.0 / tvOS 14.0)**
-   **Metal v2.3 (iOS 14.0 / tvOS 14.0)**
-   **Metal v2.4 (iOS 15.0 / tvOS 15.0)**



 |

### OS Info

-   **60 FPS:** Frame rate is limited to a maximum of 60 frames per second.

You can also edit the config values of this property.



 |

The number of buffers to keep enqueued.

A larger number of buffers will increase latency but can compensate for variable compute availability in audio callbacks on some platforms.



 |
| **Max Channels** | 

The maximum number of channels (voices) to limit for this platform.

If you specify Max Channels both here and in your global audio quality settings, your application will use the smaller of the two values.

If this is set to 0, Unreal Engine will use all the channels available.

 |
| **Sound Cue Cook Quality** | Quality level to cook SoundCues at (if set, all other levels will be stripped by the cooker). |

#### Compression Overrides

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Override Compression Times** | If enabled, overrides the Sound Group on each Sound Wave, and instead uses the Duration Threshold value to determine whether a sound should be fully decompressed during initial loading. |
| **Duration Threshold** | 
When **Override Compression Times** is enabled, any sound under this threshold (in seconds) will be fully decompressed on load.

Otherwise, the first chunk of this sound is cached at load and the rest is decompressed in real time.

If set to 0, will default to the Sound Group on the relevant Sound Wave.



 |
| **Maximum Branches on Random SoundCue Nodes** | 

On this platform, any random nodes on Sound Cues will automatically only preload this number of branches and dispose of any others on load.

This can drastically reduce memory usage.

If set to 0, no branches are culled.



 |
| **Quality Index for Sound Cues** | On this platform, use the specified quality at this index to override the quality used for SoundCues. |

Return to the [Audio](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/ios-settings-in-the-unreal-engine-project-settings#audio) table.

#### Cook Overrides

| --- | --- |
| **Resample for Device** | Enables audio resampling on this platform using the given Resampling Quality Sample Rates. |
| **Compression Quality Modifier** | 
Scales all compression qualities when cooking to this platform.

 |
| **Max Chunk Size Override (KB)** | This overrides the default maximum chunk size used when chunking audio for stream caching (ignored if < 0). |

Return to the [Cook Overrides](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/ios-settings-in-the-unreal-engine-project-settings#cookoverrides) table.
