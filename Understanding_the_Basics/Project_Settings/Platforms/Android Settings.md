## Android

### APK Packaging

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Android Package Name ('com.Company.Project', \[PROJECT\] is replaced with project name)** | 
The official name of the product (same as the name you use on the Play Store website).

The name must have at least 2 sections separated by a period, and it must be unique.



 |
| **Store Version (1-2147483647)** | The version number used to indicate newer versions in the Store. |
| **Store Version Offset (ARMv7)** | Offset to add to store version for APKs generated for ARMv7. |
| **Store Version Offset (ARM64)** | Offset to add to store version for APKs generated for ARM64. |
| **Store Version Offset (x86\_64)** | Offset to add to store version for APKs generated for x86\_64. |
| **Application Display Name (app\_name), Project Name If Blank** | 

The application name displayed for end users (`app_name`).

If this field is left blank, the engine will use the project name.



 |
| **Version Display Name (usually x.y)** | The version displayed for end users. |
| **Minimum SDK Version (19=KitKat, 21=Lollipop)** | Sets what Android version the app is allowed to be installed on (do not set this lower than 19). |
| **Target SDK Version (19=KitKat, 21=Lollipop)** | Sets what OS version the app is expected to run on (do not set this lower than 19). |
| **Install Location** | 

Preferred install location for the application.

You can choose from the following options:

-   **Internal Only:** Install your app only on internal device storage.
-   **Prefer External:** Install your app on external storage when available.
-   **Auto:** Internal storage is preferred over external, unless the internal storage is low on space.



 |
| **Enable Lint Depreciation Checks** | Enable `-Xlint:unchecked` and `-Clint:depreciation` for Java compiling (Gradle only). |
| **Package Game Data Inside .apk** | 

Defines whether the data should be placed into the `.apk` file instead of a separate `.obb` file.

Amazon requires this to be enabled, but Google Play Store does not allow `.apk` files larger than 100 MB, so only small games will work with this setting enabled.



 |
| **Generate Install Files for All Platforms** | If enabled, both batch (`.bat`) files and shell script (`.command`) files will be generated, otherwise only done for the current system (default). |
| **Disable .obb Verification on First Start or Update** | Disable the verification of an `.obb` file when it is downloaded or on first start when in a distribution build. |
| **Force Small .obb Files** | If enabled, `.obb` file size is limited to 1 GB. |
| **Allow Large .obb Files** | If enabled, `.obb` file size is not limited to the 2 GB allowed by Google Play Store, but it is still limited to the 4 GB `.zip` limit. |
| **Allow Patch .obb File** | If enabled, a patch `.obb` is generated for files not fitting in the main `.obb`. This requires using multiple `.pak` files so split up content by chunk ID. |
| **Allow Overflow .obb Files** | If enabled, up to two additional overflow `.obb` files are generated for files not fitting in the patch `.obb`. This requires using multiple `.pak` files, so you should split up content by chunk ID. |
| **Use ExternalFilesDir for UnrealGame Files** | 

If enabled, UnrealGame files will be placed in `ExternalFilesDir` which is removed on uninstall.

You should also enable this if you need to save your game progress without requesting runtime `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission in Android API 23+.



 |
| **Make Log Files Always Publicly Accessible** | 

If enabled, log files will always be placed in a publicly available directory (either `/sdcard/Android` or `/sdcard/UnrealGame`).

You may require `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission if you do not use the `ExternalFilesDir` checkbox in Android API 23+.



 |
| **Orientation** | 

The permitted orientation of the application on the device.

You can choose from the following options:

-   **Portrait:** Portrait orientation (the display is taller than it is wide).
-   **Reverse Portrait:** Portrait orientation, rotated 180 degrees.
-   **Sensor Portrait:** Use either portrait or reverse portrait orientation, where supported by the device, based on the device orientation sensor.
-   **Landscape:** Landscape orientation (the display is wider than it is tall).
-   **Reverse Landscape:** Landscape orientation, rotated 180 degrees.
-   **Sensor Landscape:** Use either landscape or reverse landscape orientation, based on the device orientation sensor.
-   **Sensor:** Use any orientation the device normally supports, based on the device orientation sensor.
-   **Full Sensor:** Use any orientation (including ones the device wouldn't choose in Sensor mode), based on the device orientation sensor.



 |
| **Maximum Supported Aspect Ratio** | 

Maximum supported aspect ratio (width / height).

Android will automatically letterbox applications on devices with bigger aspect ratio.



 |
| **Use Display Cutout Region** | Enables use of the display cutout area on Android 9+. |
| **Restore Scheduled Notifications on Reboot** | 

Defines whether the scheduled local notification should be restored on reboot.

This will add a receiver for boot complete and a permission to the manifest.



 |
| **Enable Full Screen Immersive on KitKat and Above Devices** | Defines whether the software navigation buttons should be hidden or not. |
| **Enable Improved Virtual Keyboard** | 

If enabled, you can edit the text field directly.

If disabled, tapping the in-app text field will open the additional text field for editing.



 |
| **Preferred Depth Buffer Format** | 

The preferred depth buffer bitcount for Android.

You can choose from the following options:

-   **Default**
-   **16-bit**
-   **24-bit**
-   **32-bit**



 |
| **Validate Texture Formats** | Verifies that the device supports at least one of the cooked texture formats at runtime. |
| **Force Gradle to Compress Native Libs Regardless of MinSDKVersion Setting** | 

When building for MinSDKVersion >= 23, Gradle will leave native libs uncompressed in the `.apk`.

This option may be helpful for builds that are not intended to be distributed via Google Play.



 |
| **Enable Compression of Relocation Tables (Depends on MinSDKVersion Setting)** | Generates Android binary with RELR and APS2 relocation tables when building for MinSDKVersion >= 28 or just APS2 when building for MinSDKVersion >= 23. |
| **Status of Platform Setup File** | 

This shows whether the project is configured for the Android platform.

To users from 4.6 or earlier: The engine now generates an `AndroidManifest.xml` file when building, so if you have customized your `.xml` file, you will need to put all your changes into the below settings. Note that the engine doesn't make changes to your `AndroidManifest.xml` that is in your project directory.

The `.xml` file, generated by the engine, is placed in the `(YourProjectName)\Intermediate\Android\APK` folder.

Additionally, the engine no longer uses `SigningConfig.xml`, the settings are now set in the **Distribution Signing** section.

You must accept the SDK license agreement to use Gradle. You can do this from the Project Settings > Android window if the button isn't disabled.



 |
| **Accept SDK License** | The SDK license agreement must be accepted for Gradle usage. |
| **Build Folder** | The folder containing the build files in Explorer or Finder. We recommend checking these files in to the source control to share them with your team. |

 |
| **Sound Cue Cook Quality** | Quality level to cook SoundCues at (if set, all other levels will be stripped by the cooker). |

#### Compression Overrides

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Override Compression Times** | If enabled, overrides the Sound Group on each Sound Wave, and instead uses the Duration Threshold value to determine whether a sound should be fully decompressed during initial loading. |
| **Duration Threshold** | 
When **Override Compression Times** is enabled, any sound under this threshold (in seconds) will be fully decompressed on load.

Otherwise, the first chunk of this sound is cached at load and the rest is decompressed in real time.

If this is set to 0, will default to the Sound Group on the relevant Sound Wave.



 |
| **Maximum Branches on Random SoundCue Nodes** | 

On this platform, any random nodes on Sound Cues will automatically only preload this number of branches and dispose of any others on load.

This can drastically reduce memory usage.

If this is set to 0, no branches are culled.



 |
| **Quality Index for Sound Cues** | On this platform, use the specified quality at this index to override the quality used for SoundCues on this platform. |

Return to the [Audio](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/android-settings-in-the-unreal-engine-project-settings#audio) table.

#### Cook Overrides
