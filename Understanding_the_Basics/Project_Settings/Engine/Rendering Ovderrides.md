## Rendering Overrides (Local)

### Shader Permutation Reduction

| **Section** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Force All Shader Permutation Support** | 
Enabling this will locally override all Shader Permutation Reduction settings from the Rendering section and **enable** all of those settings.

The displayed status of the settings in that section will not change.

This is saved to your local configuration files and only affects the current project.
