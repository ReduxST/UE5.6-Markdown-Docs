The **Developers** folder in the **Content Browser** is where you can duplicate and work on Assets without worrying about breaking things in your project. Use the Developers folder to experiment with different things, from small-scale Asset modification to project-wide refactors.

If you work in a shared project with other developers, each developer has their own folder.

The Developers folder uses the same name as your Windows username, but without characters that aren't allowed in Unreal Engine folder names, like periods or spaces.

Because the Developers folder is meant to act as a sandbox environment, you should never reference Assets from this folder anywhere outside this folder. Doing so can cause errors when cooking the project or cause cooking to fail.
