When working in Unreal Engine, you can access Fab directly to acquire and download plugins and assets for your project, by using the Fab window. This works similarly to accessing [Fab](https://www.fab.com/) through your browser, but there are some differences.

## Accessing Fab

To access Fab in Unreal Engine, navigate to the **Window** menu, and scroll down to **Fab** in the Get Content section.

[![Fab in the Window menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c45aafe9-271e-4976-9068-404ad19cadbc?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c45aafe9-271e-4976-9068-404ad19cadbc?resizing_type=fit)

Alternatively, you can open the **Content Drawer**, then click on the **Fab** button right next to the **Add+** button.

[![Fab button in the Content Drawer](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cec2c839-44d5-4282-9e55-e5f3001edf7a?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cec2c839-44d5-4282-9e55-e5f3001edf7a?resizing_type=fit)

### Fab Plugin

The Fab window requires the **Fab plugin**, which is enabled by default in Unreal Engine. If you can't access the Fab window, navigate to [Edit > Plugins](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/working-with-plugins-in-unreal-engine), then search for and enable the Fab plugin.

## Fab Products

The Fab window provides a way for you to find, view, and evaluate product listings, so that you can acquire these products for use in your projects in Unreal Engine. Product listings can be either free or priced. You can interact with listings both as product tiles in the Fab window, and by clicking the product tiles to view the full listing.

### Product Tiles

Product tiles in the Fab window show you basic information about the associated product. This includes:

1.  Name
    
2.  Publisher
    
3.  Rating
    
4.  Price (or Free)
    
5.  Whether the product is already saved in your library.

### Product Type Panel

You can expand each of the product types listed to show subtypes or tags, which provide a way for you to refine your list of viewed products. From there, you can use the [filter menus](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/fab-window-in-unreal-engine#product-list-and-filter-menu) to further limit the list of products you are shown in the Fab window. You can reset your product type filter by clicking **All products** at the top of the panel.

### Product List and Filter Menu

The Fab window provides a full list of products available to purchase (for priced products) or add to your library (for free products). It also provides a broad range of filtering and sorting options, available in the filter menu at the top of the product list. These are at the top of the Fab window in any view showing multiple products except the Discover view, where they are available beneath the [featured products](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/fab-window-in-unreal-engine#featured-products).

Each of the filter menu options provides a different way for you to refine your search for products in the Fab window. You can use as many filters as you like, and can clear them individually or all together using the filter tags at the top of the product list.

[![Fab window multiple filters](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1ca34f47-ca5d-48ea-ad32-49cb7d0ab5b1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1ca34f47-ca5d-48ea-ad32-49cb7d0ab5b1?resizing_type=fit)
