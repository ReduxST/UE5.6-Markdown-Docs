In this tutorial series, you'll learn about how to use and reuse Niagara simulations with Sequencer. The series discusses how to ensure that your simulation is consistent throughout a sequence, and how to reuse a simulation so that it is the same each time. It also covers how to use pre-roll warm-up so simulations are ready by the time the sequence starts, and how to handle motion blur on simulations. It concludes with considerations for working with Niagara simulations in a production environment.
