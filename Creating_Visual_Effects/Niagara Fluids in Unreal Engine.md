**Niagara Fluids** brings real-time fluid effects to Unreal Engine. By enabling the Niagara Fluids plugin, you will have access to standard fluids templates that help you get started with effects like fire, smoke, gas, and more. Take advantage of 2D templates that are optimized for games, or 3D templates designed for cinematics.

Fluid simulation methods give natural, realistic results compared with more simple particle-based setups. Fluids are built on top of the Niagara infrastructure. Advanced users can modify them without needing to write code, plugins, or data interfaces.

## Getting Started With Niagara Fluids

To get started with Niagara Fluids, start by reading the [Fluid Simulation Overview](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/fluid-simulation-in-unreal-engine---overview) document. Then, follow the [Niagara Fluids Quick-Start Guide](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/niagara-fluids-quick-start-guide-for-unreal-engine) to learn how to add the templates to your project.

## Further Reading

Niagara Fluids are built upon existing Niagara infrastructure. Fluids simulations can be heavy. You may want to create a Fluids emitter, and then bake the results out to a flipbook that you can use on any Material. Find out more about how to do that in the [Niagara Flipbook Baker Quick Start Guide](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/niagara-flipbook-baker-quick-start-guide-in-unreal-engine).

Fluids scenes can be graphically intensive, and may result in a GPU crash on Windows. If you experience this, you can find out how to fix it below.

## Reference Guides

To learn about each of the parameters that you can control within a Niagara Fluids template, read through the [Niagara Fluids Reference Guide](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/niagara-fluids-reference-in-unreal-engine).
