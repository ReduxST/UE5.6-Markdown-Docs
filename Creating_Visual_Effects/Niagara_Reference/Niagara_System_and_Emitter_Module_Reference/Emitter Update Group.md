**Emitter Update** modules occur every time the emitter ticks on the CPU. Modules in this group should compute values for Particle Spawn or Update parameters in this frame. Modules are executed in order from the top to the bottom of the stack.

Each of the module types in the Emitter Update group has its own section in this document, with tables that list and describe the default options available for that type of module. Keep in mind that you can create custom modules for any part of the Niagara emitter. The ones listed here are just the ones that are automatically included with Unreal Engine 4.

## Beam Modules

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Beam Emitter Setup | This module sets up and manages start points, endpoints and tangents for a beam emitter. |

## Chaos Modules

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Spawn from Chaos | This module causes particles to spawn in response to a Chaos event. |

## Emitter State

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Life Cycle Mode** | 
This setting determines whether life cycle (looping, age and death) is managed by the emitter itself, or by the system that owns the emitter. Settings are:

-   **System**: When you select this option, the owning system will calculate all life cycle functions. In most cases, having systems calculate life cycle increases optimization. Selecting this option hides the other fields.
-   **Self**: When you select this option, the emitter itself will calculate life cycle functions. Selecting this option makes the other settings below available.



 |
| **Inactive Response** | 

This setting determines what happens when the emitter enters the Inactive state. Inactive means the emitter is dormant and no longer able to spawn or manage particles. Options are:

-   **Complete**: Particles will finish, then the emitter is killed.
-   **Kill**: Emitter and particles are both killed immediately.
-   **Continue**: Emitter is deactivated, but does not die until the system does.



 |
| **Loop Behavior** | 

This determines the behavior of the emitter. You can select from the following:

-   **Once**: the emitter plays the animation once.
-   **Multiple**: the emitter plays the animation a fixed number of times.
-   **Infinite**: the emitter plays the animation infinitely.



 |
| **Loop Duration** | This determines how long the loop lasts. |
| **Loop Duration Mode** | This determines whether the loop is finite or infinite. |
| **Loop Delay** | This setting delays the next loop by a given amount. |
| Scalability | Â  |
| **Scalability Mode** | 

This determines whether the emitter will take scalability settings from the system, or if it will have its own unique scalability settings. You can choose from the following:

-   **System**: When you select this option, the owning system will calculate all life cycle functions. In most cases, having systems calculate life cycle increases optimization. Selecting this option hides the other fields.
-   **Self**: When you select this option, the emitter itself will calculate life cycle functions. Selecting this option makes the other settings below available.



 |
| **Enable Distance Culling** | Check this box to enable. This enables the culling of emitters based on the emitter's distance from the camera. Emitters can go to sleep, reawaken, be killed, and so on when they are a certain distance from the camera. |
| **Enable Visibility Culling** | Check this box to enable. This enables the culling of emitters based on whether they are visible to the camera. Emitters can go to sleep, reawaken, be killed, and so on based on whether they are onscreen or offscreen. |
| **Reset Age on Awaken** | Check this box to enable. When this emitter reawakens after being put to sleep by a scalability setting, this setting will reset the emitter's age. This means spawn bursts will refire, and the emitter's life cycle will restart. |

## Location Module

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Spawn Particles in Grid** | This spawns particles based on user-defined grid resolution settings. |

## MAX Scripts Module

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Spawn MS Vertex Animation Tools Morph Target** | This spawns and samples Morph Target textures that were created with the Vertex Animation Tool. The Vertex Animation Tool generates textures that represent Morph Target blend shapes. This module spawns one particle for every vertex that was captured by the tool. This module is meant to be used with the **Update MS Vertex Animation Tools Morph Target** module. |

## Spawning Modules

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Spawn Burst Instantaneous** | This module spawns a burst of particles spontaneously. |
| **Spawn Per Frame** | This module spawns a burst of particles in each frame. |
| **Spawn Per Unit** | This module spawns particles based on distance traveled in Unreal units. |
| **Spawn Rate** | This module spawns particles continuously at a particular rate. |

## Utility Module

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Emitter Frame Counter** | Enabling Increment Counter in this module sets up a counter which increments with each frame in the emitter's animation. |

## New Scratch Pad Module

Selecting this item in the **Add** (Plus sign) menu opens the **Scratch Pad** panel (by default this docks next to the **System Overview**) and places a **Scratch Pad module** in the **Selection** panel. You can also open the Scratch Pad panel by using **Windows > Scratch Pad**. However, by placing a Scratch Pad module in the stack, any modules or dynamic inputs you create in the Scratch Pad are automatically connected to your script. If you open the Scratch Pad panel using the Windows menu, any items you create there will have to be added to your script manually.

## Set New or Existing Value Directly

Selecting this item from the **Add** menu places a **Set Parameter** module in the **Selection** panel. Click the **Plus sign** (**+**) icon to select **Add Parameter** or **Create New Parameter**.

### Add Parameter

When you select **Add Parameter**, you select from the parameters listed. This adds that parameter to the **Set Parameter** module in the Emitter Update group.

Some of these parameters can be set or modified in other modules. Some are only set using a Set Parameter module.

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Emitter.Age** | This parameter defines the age of this emitter. |
| **Emitter.CurrentLoopDelay** | This parameter defines the current amount of delay before the emitter's current loop repeats. |
| **Emitter.CurrentLoopDuration** | This parameter defines the duration of the current emitter loop. |
| **Emitter.ExecutionState** | 
This affects the state of the emitter. Valid value choices are:

-   **Active**
-   **Inactive**
-   **InactiveClear**
-   **Complete**



 |
| **Emitter.ExecutionStateSource** | This indicates the source of an execution state setting. It is used to allow scalability to change the state, but only if the state has not been defined by something with higher precedence. |
| **Emitter.LocalSpace** | 

This parameter defines whether the position of particles is respective to the world origin or the owning Niagara Component's location.

-   **False**: Particle position is in WorldSpace and will be relative to the World origin. A particle with position **0,0,0** will render at the World origin.
-   **True**: Particle position is in LocalSpace and will be relative to the owning Niagara Component's location. A particle with position **0,0,0** will render at the owning Niagara Component's location.



 |
| **Emitter.LoopCount** | This parameter defines how many times the emitter's loop repeats. |
| **Emitter.LoopedAge** | This parameter calculates the age of the emitter relative to its current loop. For example, if an emitter has been active for 8 seconds and it loops every 5 seconds, the emitter's LoopedAge will be **3 seconds**. LoopedAge returns to 0 every time an emitter loops. |
| **Emitter.NormalizedLoopAge** | This parameter calculates the age of the emitter relative to its current loop, normalized from **0** to **1**. NormalizedLoopAge is expressed as **LoopedAge** divided by **CurrentLoopDuration**. If an emitter has been active for 8 seconds and it loops every 5 seconds, the emitter's LoopedAge will be **3**. The emitter's NormalizedLoopAge will be **0.6**. |
| **System.ExecutionState** | This affects the state of the system. Valid value choices are **Active**, **Inactive**, **InactiveClear**, **Complete**, **Disabled**, and **Num**. |
| **System.ExecutionStateSource** | This indicates the source of a system execution state setting. It is used to allow scalability to change the state, but only if the state has not been defined by something with higher precedence. |
