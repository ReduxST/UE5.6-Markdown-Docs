**Large World Coordinates** are now implemented across Unreal Engine. To understand its implementation in the main engine, reference this [Large World Coordinates](/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/large-world-coordinates-in-unreal-engine-5) page. In brief, the data type FVector is now `double` instead of `float`.

The Niagara implementation differs from the main engine's. Because calculations need to be done efficiently, whether on the CPU or the GPU, there are limitations that prevent working in doubles. Instead, there is a new way of storing position data in Niagara.

A sufficiently large world will be divided into a grid of tiles. When we conceive of a position in space, it has its own relative position within a tile unit, and also that tile's position in the world. See the following diagram for a conceptual representation of what this might look like.

Previously, Niagara positions were interchangeable with vectors, defined as the direction and distance away from the world origin. Now, for the information to be meaningful, additional data is required to locate the emitter relative to the tile it is in.

In UE5, to save not just the position relative to the origin but also the information of which tile the system is in, we need a new data format. This way, we can distinguish between other types of vectors, and positions that carry this additional data.

## Position Data in UE4 and UE5

The main difference between UE4 and UE5 is how we store the position data of particles, that is, `Particles.Position`.

| Â  | **UE4** | **UE5** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Particles.Position type** | Vector | Position |
| **Local space emitter** | `Particles.Position` is relative to the Niagara system's origin in the game | `Particles.Position` is relative to the Niagara system's origin in the game (unchanged) |
| **World space emitter** | `Particles.Position` is relative to the game's origin (0,0,0) | `Particles.Position` is relative to the system's position when it activated. For small coordinates, this is still the game's origin. For larger coordinates, this may be an arbitrary number. |

## How to Enable or Disable Large World Coordinates in Niagara

### Large World Coordinates in the Project

By default, Large World Coordinates are turned on in new projects. The system will automatically convert your projects when you open them in UE5.

If your project is not large enough to require large world coordinate support, you can turn it off completely in **Edit > Project Settings**. Under **Plugins > Niagara**, locate the setting **System Support Large World Coordinates**, then disable it for your project.

### Large World Coordinates in a System

You may want to have Large World Coordinates turned on for the project, but disabled for a specific, individual system. In this case, you can edit your Niagara system in the Niagara Editor. In the **System Properties**, under the **Rendering** section, you can disable **Support Large World Coordinates**.

## How to Test Large World Coordinates in Niagara

When you first update a project file from UE4 to UE5, or as you begin to test your system, you may want to validate that your Niagara systems behave properly in large world coordinates. To test whether a Niagara system works with large world coordinates, you need to move it outside of the first tile. There are several ways to do this, as outlined below.

### Move the Effect Very Far Away

You can move your effect very far away from the origin, then play the effect and validate the behavior. This is the only way to test this without making any changes in the engine code itself. For example, you could move the system 3000000 units away from the origin, and this will place it in a tile outside the original tile.

### Change the Constant for Tile Size

You can also change the tile size for the large world coordinate tiles in the constant definition. In `Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/Misc/LargeWorldRenderPosition.cpp`, change `UE_LWC_RENDER_TILE_SIZE` to something very small, for example 10 units. Now, when you place your effect in the level, so long as it is more than 10 units away from the origin, it will be in a new tile.

## Updating Existing Projects

### Particles.Position in HLSL

If you wrote custom scripts in HLSL for your project, you need to update these to work with large world coordinates. In previous versions, you may have used HLSL to directly set `Particles.Position` to a fixed value. This does not work with large world coordinates.

Instead, you can either disable large world coordinate support for that asset or convert the worldspace vector to a position.

If you need to know what tile you are in, this is stored in `Engine.Owner.LWCTile`.

### Custom Modules

Using the **Niagara Script Editor**, or the **Scratch Pad**, you can create your own custom modules. If you already created custom modules in a previous version, they may not work implicitly when converted to a project using large world coordinates.

The reason for this is the difference between position data, that includes the tile information, and normal vectors, that do not. Core parameters like `Particles.Position` are automatically converted to the type `position`, but custom vector inputs connected to them are not.

In the following example, **Box Origin** uses `Particles.Position` as a default binding. However, it is not, itself, a `position` type.

To maintain backwards compatibility, the existing connections are kept and the position type is converted to a normal vector type.

#### Changing the Type of an Existing Vector Input

In a Niagara Script, if you have existing modules you may want to update some parameters to be of type `position`. To change the type of an existing vector input or output to a position type, do the following:

1.  Open the module script in the **Niagara Script Editor**.
    
2.  In the **Parameter** tab, right-click the parameter(s) whose type you want to change.
    
3.  Select **Change Type > Position** from the contextual menu.

If you change a parameter to type position, and it is connected to a parameter of a different type, it will create an orphaned pin connection. This way, you can decide what to do next: whether to change the other parameter type as well, or convert the data from one type to another.

You can only change parameters that are owned by this script. If you are inheriting a parameter from outside, you will see that parameter is locked and the type cannot be changed.

#### Converting Between Vector and Position in a Node Graph

If you connect together a `vector` and a `position` in a node graph, the system will add in a convert node, **Position -> Vector** or **Vector -> Position**. However, be aware this copies the values without taking into account the large world transformation if it takes place outside the origin tile. This could result in a loss of crucial information.

If you want to convert a position type to a worldspace vector, you can use the function **Position to Vector**. In the reverse, to convert a worldspace vector to a position, you can use **Vector to Position**.

Whenever you convert from a position to a vector or the reverse, there's potentially a loss of data. This can result in a loss of precision, or some unpredictable behaviors when outside of the origin tile. To be safe, from start to end you should use positions without converting. Conversions to world space should ideally only take place in data interfaces or renderers.

### Export Particle Data Interface

You can use the **Export Particle** data interface to send position data to blueprints. If you already used this previously, you will need to update your blueprint for large world coordinates.

There is a parameter in the **Receive Particle Data** event node node called **Simulation Position Offset**. This stores the offset data for the tile that you are in. You can add this at the end of a script to the simulation position to convert from simulation space back to world space.

### Dynamic Material Parameters

Position data carries additional information about the tile offset that cannot be linked directly to a vector that does not carry this information. If your project is set up so that you are exporting position data to a material by using a dynamic input to bind to that material in the renderer, then this will not work with large world coordinates. To fix this, you can convert the position data to a world space vector.

![Converting position data exported to a Material.](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/d369fdbb-eac4-44a3-ba70-18a57b4542fc/convert-material-export-data.png)

For large coordinates, the additional offset information of which tile you are in is lost, so this can result in an overflow for large coordinates.

If you still have a Material binding to use, you can link it to `Engine.Owner.LWCTile` to add this offset information back in again.

In the Material itself, you can also use the **ConvertNiagaraPositionToWorldspace** Material function to add the tile offset to the simulation position.

### Custom Data Interfaces

If you have created any custom data interfaces that contain functions that work with world space positions, then these will need to be updated.

As needed, replace existing functions to use `FNiagaraPosition` type instead of `FVector` for their inputs and outputs. You can override `UNiagaraDataInterface::UpgradeFunctionCall` to upgrade existing function usages.

To transform simulation positions, you can get a helper object from the system instance:

```

		`FNiagaraLWCConverter LWCConverter = SystemInstance->GetLWCConverter();`

Copy full snippet
```
FNiagaraLWCConverter LWCConverter = SystemInstance->GetLWCConverter();

For GPU data interface functions, you can get the system's large world coordinate tile from the `FNiagaraDataInterfaceArgs` supplied to the shader context. If you need to see an example of this, you can check existing usages like the camera data interface.

### Custom Renderers

Any custom renderer reading position data also needs to be updated. Similar to data interfaces, you can get a converter from the system instance. The only difference is that you also need to know if you're rendering a **localspace emitter** or not:

```

		`FNiagaraLWCConverter LwcConverter = SystemInstance->GetLWCConverter(bIsLocalSpaceEmitter);`

Copy full snippet
```
FNiagaraLWCConverter LwcConverter = SystemInstance->GetLWCConverter(bIsLocalSpaceEmitter);

Any particle position you read can then be transformed into worldspace using the following:

```

		`FVector WSPos = LwcConverter.ConvertSimulationPositionToWorld(SimPos);`

Copy full snippet
```
FVector WSPos = LwcConverter.ConvertSimulationPositionToWorld(SimPos);

Please check existing Niagara renderers for examples of how this is already implemented.
